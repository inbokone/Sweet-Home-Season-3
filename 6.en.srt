SWEET HOME

3
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,899
I think I'm starting to understand you.

4
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,447
I've always mocked you…

5
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,284
but now I'm in your shoes.

6
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,371
Tell me, Hyun-su.

7
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,290
Why did I do it?

8
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,043
Why?!

9
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,965
Why did I save Eun-hyeok?

10
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:38,056
Letting Eun-yu live
and making a stupid bet about you.

11
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,812
Those are things you would do.

12
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,070
You asked me who I am.

13
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,449
From the very beginning…

14
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,580
I was you.

15
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,376
I was always a part of you.

16
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,463
I was…

17
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,094
another version of you

18
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,721
that you wanted to hide.

19
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,934
Are you listening?

20
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,229
I'm sure you are.

21
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,066
I know I was.

22
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,577
If we become one…

23
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,833
who will be the first to wake up?

24
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,326
Cha Hyun-su?

25
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,852
Let's make one thing clear.

26
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,605
You're helping me now.

27
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,857
Not the other way around.

28
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,370
I'm sorry I took so long.

29
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,338
Cha Hyun-su.

30
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,226
Is it really you?

31
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,152
Is everyone at the stadium?

32
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,239
Yeah.

33
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,449
Let's go then.

34
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,953
You can have that.

35
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,497
You might be fast,

36
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,833
but that might not be enough.

37
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,000
You remember the elephant slide?

38
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,170
The one that had a hole
right in the middle.

39
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,548
I could never find you
when you hid in there.

40
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,927
Whenever we played hide-and-seek,
that was your spot.

41
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,971
You'd hide until I eventually cried.

42
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,059
You know how I found you?

43
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,187
Once, I gave up on looking
and played with the neighbor's dog.

44
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,106
Then its leash snapped,
so I had to run like crazy.

45
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,110
Then your head popped out of the hole.

46
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,112
And so I caught you.

47
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,658
You were sweating buckets
having to run with me on your back.

48
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,285
Cut to the chase.

49
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,873
Learn.

50
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,502
With memories,
you can relearn your emotions.

51
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,464
Then stick to the facts.

52
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,008
The leash never snapped.

53
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,970
You unleashed it
because you felt bad for the dog.

54
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,603
I guess your ankle is okay now.

55
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,439
It's no longer a nuisance.

56
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,820
Are you hurt?

57
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,156
No, I'm fine.

58
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,076
You look happy.

59
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,204
Do I?

60
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,791
I am happy.

61
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,752
It feels like a dream.

62
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,006
You and Eun-hyeok are back.

63
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,289
Take your positions.

64
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,134
Split up without being caught
by the special infectees.

65
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:53,264
Gather as many survivors as possible
and wait for the signal.

66
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,142
FOOD AND WATER AT CHURCH
PS. FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED

67
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,059
Tonight,

68
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,147
we will escape from the stadium
with the survivors.

69
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:43,856
Excuse me.

70
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,984
Ma'am?

71
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,245
I don't want the Platoon's help.

72
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,625
Please come with me.

73
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,168
Get lost!

74
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,214
I know you all want me to die.

75
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,802
Yong-seok went there because of me.

76
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,523
I wanted to stay alive…

77
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,402
even for just a few more days.

78
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,531
So I made him go.

79
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,661
Do you still want to help me?

80
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,000
That idiot.

81
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,130
Just let me pay for my sins.

82
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,799
I won't last long anyway.

83
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,309
Jeez.

84
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,649
- Are you looking for the kid?
- Holy crap!

85
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,234
Damn it!

86
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,320
You scared me!

87
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,904
The thing is,

88
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,951
I've been observing everybody,
and no one is trying as hard as you.

89
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,996
You want to join us?

90
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,373
You'd be joining me.

91
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,044
All right, let's hear it.

92
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,420
What's your plan?

93
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,631
Let's hand over the kid

94
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,549
and get out of here.

95
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,802
You want to go through all that trouble
and go out there to die?

96
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,137
That's ridiculous.

97
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,181
Get lost.

98
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,807
How will you catch her?

99
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,312
She's not an ordinary kid.

100
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,897
Her turning humans into monsters?

101
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,482
Who'd believe that?

102
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,692
- Bullcrap.
- I saw it.

103
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,072
I saw her turn a human into a monster.

104
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,911
Do you have a plan?

105
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,208
You're working as a group, aren't you?

106
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,462
Would it be okay to use humans
for such an important matter?

107
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,924
You're worried about that

108
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,300
after losing my kid?

109
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,514
Look how hard they're working,

110
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,265
unlike you all.

111
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,561
Where are Jae-jin and Ja-yeong?

112
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,897
I will bring them here, sir.

113
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,482
Get rid of them.

114
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,442
Sorry?

115
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,073
Kill them.

116
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,677
They're waiting for people to get here.

117
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,512
What? Are you serious?

118
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,723
Didn't they say
it was first come, first served?

119
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,851
Are they lying about giving us food?

120
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,145
- I should've just looked for the kid.
- You fool.

121
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,063
And what if you turn into a monster?

122
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,648
What would be the point?

123
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,195
Where are you going?

124
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,074
I need to find someone.

125
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,951
Then you should wait.

126
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,453
They'll be here.

127
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,954
You don't even know who I'm talking about.

128
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:35,838
Please go back in.

129
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,008
You can't lock me up here
without an explanation.

130
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,509
You're not being locked up.

131
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,636
You're being protected.

132
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,722
You'll find out soon enough.

133
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,381
Damn it.

134
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,676
Why are you so late?

135
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,845
Did Sang-won talk your ear off?

136
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,306
I can't wait all day, you know?

137
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,852
Did you get it out?

138
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,826
Are you ready?

139
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,333
Don't tell Sang-won about this.

140
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,213
He doesn't know
this is how his underlings came about.

141
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,256
If he finds out,

142
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,758
he'll lose it.

143
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:05,928
By the way,

144
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,973
what did he talk about?

145
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,267
The kid's gone.

146
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,895
She's quite something, isn't she?

147
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,148
I wonder how she managed to get away.

148
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,944
Apparently,
she can turn humans into monsters.

149
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,656
What?

150
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,270
Jeez, you startled me.

151
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,980
So how did it go?

152
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,523
Did you find the kid?

153
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,369
Say that again.

154
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,872
Turn who into what?

155
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,625
- You didn't know?
- Wait a minute.

156
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,673
Is it true?

157
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,559
Is it actually true?

158
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,441
I'm sorry, Sergeant Tak.

159
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,110
I think

160
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,863
I should keep this medicine with me.

161
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,701
I found a test subject
that's better than you.

162
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,162
What?

163
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,666
This was actually meant for me.

164
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,921
I would've taken this
if I had shown symptoms.

165
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:07,424
But those damn symptoms
never showed up for me.

166
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,678
They showed up for just about everyone,
so why not me?

167
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,063
I was momentarily giving way to others
for the sake of humanity.

168
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,236
And I guess
this is my reward from the gods.

169
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,542
I wonder where the kid is.

170
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,849
Are you crazy?
What the hell are you doing?

171
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,601
What's up with you all?

172
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,105
What the hell?

173
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,606
What's going on?

174
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,043
Where's my dad?

175
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,312
Where the heck is he?

176
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,779
Follow us quietly.

177
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,364
Sorry?

178
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,621
What's going on?

179
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,763
It's you!

180
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,807
You're the scary-looking soldier.

181
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,308
Is your name…

182
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,310
Master Sergeant Tak?

183
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,024
You know…

184
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,986
Park Chan-yeong
and Kim Yeong-hu, don't you?

185
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,212
Why are you here
and not looking for the kid?

186
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,757
Being symptomatic doesn't exempt you.

187
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,636
That used to be my seat.

188
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,347
Are you serious?

189
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,475
You still can't let go of that?

190
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,436
I hear

191
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,022
you'll move into the kid's body
when she's found.

192
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,734
I guess my friend has a big mouth.

193
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,279
Not always.

194
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,031
He didn't tell you about your underlings.

195
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,078
He used your blood to create them.

196
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,585
Maybe that's why
they're so obedient to you.

197
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,511
You didn't know?

198
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,055
Well, I thought you did.

199
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,309
I didn't expect you to get fooled
by someone like him.

200
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,233
Come on now.

201
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,403
I'm just saying it's a shame.

202
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,365
I thought I'd get an opportunity too.

203
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,331
Are you offering to join my side now?

204
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,210
Why not?

205
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,088
One vial of your blood is still out there.

206
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,802
It was taken
from an MH named Ja-yeong, but…

207
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,013
But?

208
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,392
Dr. Lim swallowed it.

209
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,964
Kim Yeong-hu.

210
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,301
Master Sergeant Tak.

211
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,265
I heard you called me a scary-looking man.

212
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,186
Am I wrong, sir?

213
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,191
You're always frowning

214
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,944
and barely speak.

215
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,381
I should've listened to you, sir.

216
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,217
Yong-seok,

217
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,595
Seo-jin,

218
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,221
U-seok,

219
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,139
Jong-hyun,

220
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,640
and Seok-chan.

221
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,143
Sergeant Choi,

222
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,812
as well as
the members of the search party…

223
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,733
have all died in action.

224
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,278
The operation was a failure.

225
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,782
We shouldn't have gone.

226
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,660
Everything is my fault, even the fact that
those monsters entered the stadium.

227
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,413
And yet,

228
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,166
only I returned alive.

229
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,838
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't be.

230
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,132
I gave the orders.

231
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,803
And I lied to you all.

232
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,889
I'm symptomatic.

233
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,894
And I have been even before
I sent you all to Bamseom.

234
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,606
I kept it a secret to protect this place,

235
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,733
but ultimately…

236
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,780
I just failed to be honest with you guys.

237
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,163
Yeong-hu.

238
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,334
Yes, sir?

239
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,924
What kind of monster will I be?

240
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,477
You've been a soldier through and through.

241
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,230
Either you'll kill…

242
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,191
or you'll protect.

243
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,401
What about a bomb?

244
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,280
Then at least I could become of use.

245
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,201
That won't be enough.

246
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,997
Also, I'm not too surprised.

247
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,960
You were always a monster, sir.

248
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,879
Haven't you heard the rumors?

249
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,549
And if necessary,

250
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,261
we'll make use of you,
even when you're a monster.

251
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,850
So please hold on

252
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,810
until the end.

253
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,063
You'll be more useful to us then.

254
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,694
That's a soldier's fate, isn't it?

255
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,302
Eun-yu.

256
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,180
Lee Eun-yu.

257
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,395
I'm going to work now.

258
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,521
Eun-yu.

259
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,400
Eat a proper meal, all right?

260
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,946
I'll report you missing if you're gone.

261
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,990
Take any food, medicine, and weapons
you have and come to the first floor.

262
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,701
Survivors in the building,
it'll be safer to stay together.

263
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,209
We survivors…

264
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,628
must stick together.

265
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,563
Eun-hyeok!

266
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:10,860
Thank you.

267
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,532
Thank you for showing up.

268
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,434
Hyun-su.

269
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,813
Just follow this road.

270
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,773
You'll know when you get close.

271
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,818
If you can't walk,

272
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,612
I'll carry you.

273
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,287
I'll just take a short break here
and catch up.

274
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,292
Hurry.

275
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,837
It'll bother me more if I hold you back.

276
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,674
Ms. Cha and Yeong-su will be there too.

277
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:17,969
You know what?

278
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,056
People are going to be
so happy to see you.

279
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,100
Get to the point.

280
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,436
What is it?

281
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,280
Listen.

282
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,659
If I change like Eun-hyeok,

283
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,746
then…

284
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,374
then please…

285
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,127
help me relearn everything.

286
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:58,051
And be patient with me
even if I'm rude to you.

287
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,890
Are you not…

288
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,685
going to tell Eun-hyeok?

289
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,822
I'll bring them back no matter what.

290
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,159
We have to meet them again.

291
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,011
He's really grown up.

292
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,535
Stay with her if you're worried.

293
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,538
Don't be so cold.

294
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,415
She's your sister.

295
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,917
No, she's your first love.

296
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,627
We don't share a drop of blood.

297
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:23,928
What is it?

298
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,932
Is this about Eun-yu becoming a monster?

299
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,354
You knew.

300
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,274
Eun-yu's safe,

301
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,235
so focus on our goal.

302
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,695
She's still in the process.

303
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,448
And if she does turn,

304
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,117
she'll be able to protect herself.

305
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,870
Listen.

306
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,831
If I change like Eun-hyeok,

307
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,669
then…

308
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,172
then please…

309
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,009
help me relearn everything.

310
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,933
And be patient with me
even if I'm rude to you.

311
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,977
Just let it slide…

312
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,232
even if I give you crap.

313
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,071
Do you really feel no emotion?

314
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,658
Or is it on purpose?

315
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,161
You're pretending, aren't you?

316
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,121
Cha Hyun-su.

317
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,376
Do you even want to
kill the special infectees?

318
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,338
Right now, I want to kill you.

319
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,216
Then do it.

320
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,677
I'll be reborn anyway.

321
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,139
Why did you even show up?

322
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,143
You should've just died.

323
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,647
Again, I can't die.

324
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,985
There's no point talking anymore.

325
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,945
Good idea.

326
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,822
You just stay that way.

327
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,699
I know what to do now.

328
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,868
No matter what happens,

329
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,788
I'm going to find you
and bring you back to Eun-yu.

330
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,323
Hello?

331
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,075
Hey, over there!

332
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,231
Where are you, Yeong-su?

333
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,194
Ms. Cha.

334
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,112
Isn't he part of the Platoon?

335
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,435
Have you…

336
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,524
Have you

337
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,235
seen Yeong-su?

338
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,494
What are you doing?

339
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,571
Let go of me.

340
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,490
This woman…

341
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,493
doesn't even recognize you.

342
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,417
Let's go, Ms. Cha.

343
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,712
Something's not right with them.

344
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:11,883
Is that you, Yeong-su?

345
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,651
What's that?

346
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,243
What's happening?

347
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,253
Ms. Cha.

348
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,217
Ms. Cha.

349
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,301
We need to go.

350
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,887
Come on.

351
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,347
It's dangerous!

352
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,688
My dear Yeong-su.

353
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,028
You…

354
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,615
You really are Yeong-su.

355
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,134
Yeong-su…

356
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:29,896
There you are.

357
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,023
Here she--

358
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,011
Mister.

359
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,057
Please don't.

360
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,326
Look.

361
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,205
You remember me, don't you?

362
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,583
You brought my daughter back to me.

363
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:45,883
Thank you.

364
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,354
He's Yeong-su!

365
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,237
Yi-su.

366
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,656
Watch closely.

367
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,200
This is what happens when you run away.

368
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:07,342
