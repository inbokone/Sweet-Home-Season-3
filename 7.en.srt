ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON SWEET HOME

00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,976
SWEET HOME

3
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,441
I got new hands.

4
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,822
I have hands now!

5
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,119
It's time to go.

6
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,914
Sorry?

7
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,874
He wants you dead.

8
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,300
I don't want your blood on my hands.

9
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,014
This is my last act of courtesy to you.

10
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,564
I did everything I was told to.

11
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,151
You've seen it firsthand.

12
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,656
I thought we were one.

13
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,536
You said I was one of you.

14
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,464
If you keep doing this,

15
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,717
I'll have to kill you myself.

16
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,363
He'll abandon you too.

17
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,053
- What the heck?
- What?

18
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,889
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

19
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,348
What's with the lights?

20
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,979
Is this part of your plan, sir?

21
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,648
No, but it can help us.

22
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,566
Sergeant Tak!

23
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,443
We must leave now.

24
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,028
Everyone must be evacuated.

25
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,448
- What's wrong?
- There are more symptomatic individuals.

26
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,993
And there are too many of them to count.

27
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,418
Get these survivors out of here
as safely as possible.

28
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:31,961
I'll see you outside.

29
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,713
To your positions.

30
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:35,840
Let's go.

31
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,642
What's going on?

32
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,437
Did you kidnap me?

33
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,898
Jeez.

34
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,212
You must be Sang-won's daughter.

35
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,010
You two don't look alike.

36
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,263
What do I even do now?

37
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,224
Hi.

38
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,686
Shall we shake hands?

39
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,609
It's nice to meet you.

40
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,739
Did you say it was pain?

41
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,831
To free myself from this damn body.

42
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,590
I think you're right.

43
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,968
Pain…

44
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,554
gives me life.

45
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,975
Let's put it to the test.

46
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,064
I'd feel so much pain if you died.

47
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,901
Wait.

48
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,944
What's wrong?

49
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,031
Is this not what you expected?

50
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,658
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

51
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,247
I'm here to help you, all right?

52
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,544
Since when?

53
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,133
Are you sure you didn't
just use me all this time?

54
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,974
You thought I wouldn't know?

55
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,738
I wonder how far down it is.

56
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,782
Why you?

57
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,034
Why you and not me?!

58
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,496
I wanted it more.

59
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,916
I should've been a monster!

60
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,544
So why?!

61
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,796
I told you.

62
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,216
I was chosen.

63
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,719
Do it to me.

64
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,347
Please.

65
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,642
Please.

66
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,647
Please do it.

67
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,359
Please.

68
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,197
Do it to me.

69
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,281
Please…

70
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,670
I'm going to become one.

71
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,797
I'm going to become one too!

72
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,510
I'll see…

73
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,637
what you see…

74
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,431
when I become an MH.

75
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,600
- I…
- My friend.

76
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,978
You don't deserve to.

77
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,904
I want to see it!

78
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,989
I want to see it!

79
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,299
Calm down.

80
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,386
Come with me.

81
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,836
Chi-seong.

82
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,632
Did you get rid of them?

83
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,343
Yes, sir.

84
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,182
Good job.

85
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,978
Your work here is done.

86
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,719
Come with me.

87
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,674
We're so close, Yi-su.

88
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,455
No one's here either.

89
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,083
The bleeding stopped unnaturally.

90
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,422
It was probably a special infectee.

91
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,591
It's clear they were here.

92
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,059
Do you know what you did wrong?

93
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,063
How could you leave without a word?

94
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,607
When did you get here?

95
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,654
Are you hurt?

96
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,783
Did you leave with Eun-yu?

97
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,916
Never mind. Don't tell me.

98
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,835
I don't want to hear it.

99
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,630
You're still alive.

100
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,800
That's all that matters.

101
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,139
I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was leaving.

102
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,193
Chan-yeong.

103
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,828
She's a monster.

104
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,807
They're symptomatic.

105
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,479
They're not in their usual state.

106
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,732
It's not like they volunteered for this.

107
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,778
Let's split up.

108
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,655
What?

109
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,325
Whoever finds him first
can take care of him.

110
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,202
Why?

111
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,121
Are you scared to go alone?

112
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,207
No, I'm just worried about you.

113
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,752
It'd be a nuisance
if you just died anywhere.

114
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,966
Who taught you to smile like that?

115
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,635
I saw a picture.

116
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,054
It doesn't suit you.

117
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,458
What took you so long?

118
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,754
Are you…

119
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,425
okay?

120
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,724
I think so.

121
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,230
Where's Yi-kyung?

122
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,319
Have you met her yet?

123
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,280
I have.

124
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,574
Where is she?

125
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,869
I'll take you to her.

126
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,615
Groups one, two, and three are here, sir.

127
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,532
What about Jin-ho?

128
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,410
He's with an advance party
to locate the exit.

129
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,662
He'll be back soon.

130
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,663
All right.

131
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,331
Let's move.

132
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,290
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,708
Crow Platoon, start moving.

134
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,169
Let's get going, everyone. Follow us.

135
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,087
Let's go.

136
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,214
Take your positions.

137
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,735
Hold out for a little longer.

138
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,781
Yong-seok…

139
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,328
fought until the very end.

140
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:41,216
FOR HIV/AIDS

141
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,327
There's someone I don't see here.

142
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,538
Are you sure you're evacuating everyone?

143
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,798
You should worry about yourself.

144
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,944
I don't have to go with them.

145
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,073
I'll just go to you, Lord.

146
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,785
But please…

147
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,789
let Yeong-jun go.

148
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,209
Let him fly free as a bird.

149
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,508
Where's everyone?

150
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,760
Why are you alone?

151
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,430
They went home.

152
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,024
Did you…

153
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,693
wait for me here?

154
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,320
Because you're into me?

155
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,239
Is that it?

156
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,908
That's why you stayed, right?

157
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,020
Stop.

158
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,984
Stop.

159
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,194
Yeong-jun!

160
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,284
Stop it.

161
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,755
Why are you here?

162
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,843
Why are you here all alone
when everyone else is escaping?

163
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,136
I waited for you,

164
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,096
so we could go together.

165
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,184
Yeong-jun.

166
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,563
I'm sorry for bringing you
all the way here.

167
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,566
Will you stick with me to the end?

168
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,778
Where are we going?

169
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,490
Wherever it may be.

170
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,576
Stop the car, Seon-hwa.

171
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,703
Seon-hwa.

172
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:40,997
Seon-hwa.

173
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,925
Someone save Yeong-jun!

174
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,927
Please help!

175
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,264
Help!

176
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,473
Yeong-jun.

177
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,769
I'm sorry.

178
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,822
Damn it.

179
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,246
Let's go.

180
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,416
Let's get out of here.

181
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,587
Let's go.

182
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,331
Sergeant Tak.

183
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,046
Sergeant Tak?

184
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:20,472
Sergeant Tak.

185
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,822
Did you find the exit?

186
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,617
It's located as marked on the map, sir.

187
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,787
All right.

188
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,125
Go.

189
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,424
Sergeant Tak!

190
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,052
- Take the survivors and go.
- Out of the way!

191
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,098
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir!

192
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,244
Sergeant Tak!

193
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,498
Are you all right, sir?

194
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,342
You can't go.

195
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,761
I won't let you.

196
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,319
I won't let you leave.

197
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,823
Get out of the way!

198
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,401
OFFICE

199
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,137
You shouldn't be attacking me.

200
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,517
Sergeant Tak…

201
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,435
Yeong-hu.

202
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,772
What kind of monster will I be?

203
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,693
You've been a soldier through and through.

204
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,571
Either you'll kill…

205
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,490
or you'll protect.

206
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,742
What about a bomb?

207
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,621
Then at least I could become of use.

208
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,138
You're responsible…

209
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,809
for all those symptomatic individuals,
aren't you?

210
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,354
Yeah, I made them that way.

211
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,023
What about it?

212
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,861
Have you ever thought about
what Yi-kyung was thinking…

213
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,699
when she came here?

214
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,834
Why should I…

215
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,213
care about that?

216
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,968
Because she didn't raise you a monster.

217
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,555
She raised you a human.

218
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,889
That's the problem.

219
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,727
Why raise a monster

220
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,438
as a human?

221
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,316
Where is she?

222
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,445
Where's Yi-kyung?

223
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,866
She's dead.

224
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,493
Or more precisely…

225
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,205
I killed her.

226
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,377
You keep blabbering…

227
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,882
about that Yi-kyung.

228
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,554
Aren't you here to see me?

229
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,142
Cha…

230
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,313
Hyun-su.

231
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,402
Long time no see.

232
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,738
Long time no see.

233
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,916
You're still in there, aren't you?

234
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,212
I'm coming to get you.

235
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,590
Don't give up.

236
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,676
Ever.

237
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,424
You really don't give up, do you?

238
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,637
Who are you?

239
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,640
Me?

240
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,020
Pyeon Sang-wook.

241
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,689
Jung Ui-myeong.

242
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,734
Seo Yi-kyung's fiancé.

243
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,031
This kid's father.

244
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,370
My real name is Nam Sang-won.

245
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,124
Apparently, we don't look alike.

246
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,626
What do you think?

247
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,086
Would you agree?

248
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,632
Well, I guess it's not important.

249
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,344
Now, I am her,

250
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,763
and she is me.

251
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,270
I didn't know you two were so close.

252
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,607
Where were you all this time then?

253
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,238
Does she even need your help?

254
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,158
When I got her the second time,

255
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,411
she didn't put up a fight.

256
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,215
What the fuck?

257
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,953
Are you still confused?

258
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,247
The special infectee

259
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,207
is in front of you.

260
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,126
I can't kill him like this.

261
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,670
- You're not able to?
- I choose not to.

262
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,256
Do as I say or fight me.

263
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,178
It's your fault we didn't
get the job done this time.

264
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,377
Did you really think that would work?

265
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,089
Not yet.

266
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,176
Give me some time.

267
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,223
I'll get him out…

268
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,270
and kill him for good no matter what.

269
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,147
I don't know about that.

270
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,027
Can you do it?

271
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,656
I'm not alone anymore, you see.

272
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,656
Good luck.

273
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:16,899
