1
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,637
Perhaps I trusted you too much.

2
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,854
Yi-kyung sure didn't look like a monster.

3
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,025
She turned human again.

4
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,570
I turned her into a monster,

5
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,448
so she wouldn't die.

6
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,162
Why did you kill her?!

7
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,417
She's useless now.

8
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,628
Unlike you.

9
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,728
No…

10
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,416
Get out!

11
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,511
Fuck!

12
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,722
Mom…

13
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,479
No! Let go!

14
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,731
Mom!

15
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,191
No!

16
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,652
No!

17
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,029
Mom!

18
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,949
No!

19
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,909
No!

20
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,536
Please!

21
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,047
ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

22
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,586
SWEET HOME

23
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,184
Damn it.

24
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,606
You only got this far?

25
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,452
Fuck…

26
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,060
So I guess you've completely
taken over Cha Hyun-su.

27
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,105
I thought he was a weak bastard.

28
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,983
But I guess I was wrong.

29
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,403
The only weak bastard here is you.

30
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,822
No, you're a fake.

31
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,950
The real Cha Hyun-su

32
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,993
is gone, isn't he?

33
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,215
He wasn't alone?

34
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,721
I don't know who he is,

35
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,891
but it seems he's resisting
like Hyun-su is.

36
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,562
They definitely didn't look like
the best of friends.

37
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,607
Hyun-su probably has him.

38
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,235
That's a relief then.

39
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,281
That means they aren't working together.

40
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,536
Hyun-su might be aggressive,
but he can't lay a finger on you.

41
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,998
I don't know why
he's going to the stadium,

42
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,459
but now is our only chance to stop him.

43
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,186
What are you doing?

44
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,230
Let's go.

45
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,148
It's a car.

46
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,234
A car is approaching!

47
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,202
He was alive.

48
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,713
Fuck.

49
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,894
I guess you can pull it out
whenever you want now.

50
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,028
You look healthy.

51
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,575
And it's just as well.
It's going to be tough from now on.

52
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:33,828
Good.

53
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,706
It's going to be tough from here on out.

54
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,462
I thought you dropped dead already.

55
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,300
You sound tough, but you should
really work on your poker face.

56
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,844
Did you miss me?

57
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,266
So damn much.

58
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,310
I knew you would.

59
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,396
I feel the same way.

60
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,899
I need you now.

61
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,119
You've gotten fast.

62
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,537
Perhaps you've gotten slow.

63
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,580
Oh yeah?

64
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,056
Can you help me again?

65
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,143
You think I'm going to fall for that
like Hyun-su did?

66
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,937
You'll have to

67
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,356
because I'm going to make you.

68
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,874
Stop running away like a fucking rat!

69
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,797
You ever think you're going about this
the wrong way,

70
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,175
swinging that massive thing
in such a tight space?

71
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,846
Are you nothing without your wing?

72
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,232
Good. Use your head.

73
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,734
Fuck you.

74
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,862
You're still an asshole, aren't you?

75
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,992
Eun-hyeok!

76
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:45,960
It's him.

77
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,255
It's actually Eun-hyeok.

78
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,761
Eun-hyeok!

79
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:57,847
Eun-hyeok!

80
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,309
Congratulations on your first girlfriend.

81
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,353
You son of a bitch.

82
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,957
Hyun-su, no!

83
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,376
Eun-hyeok! No!

84
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,961
No!

85
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,932
You sure you can do this?

86
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,393
Maybe pull out that thing again.

87
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,146
I don't need it.

88
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,233
Kang Seok-chan.

89
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,154
Min Seo-jin.

90
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,281
Jeong Jong-hyun.

91
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,366
Choi Yong-seok.

92
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:19,845
Sergeant Kim!

93
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,685
Watch out, Sarge!

94
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,025
Sir!

95
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,527
Do you take me for a fucking joke?!

96
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,660
I'm going to fucking kill Cha Hyun-su.

97
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,919
No!

98
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,963
Eun-hyeok! No!

99
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,675
Eun-hyeok!

100
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,553
Eun-hyeok, no!

101
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,096
Eun-hyeok!

102
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,141
You can't get out now.

103
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,392
Have fun in there.

104
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,986
Why did you have to butt in?

105
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,824
Now is not the time.

106
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,791
Let go.

107
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,710
No.

108
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,046
Remember I told you
I was looking for someone?

109
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,215
That's him.

110
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,596
That's my brother, so let me go!

111
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,513
Let me go!

112
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,932
Use your head.

113
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,810
I thought you could pull it out whenever.

114
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,332
What are you going to do now?

115
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,001
Cheer you on.

116
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,962
So you're basically not going to do shit.

117
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,132
I want to see what you're capable of.

118
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,190
Can you get out?

119
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,446
Aren't you fast?

120
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,949
Jump out when there's a gap.

121
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,618
What about you?

122
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,537
I'm not weak like you.

123
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,039
Let go!

124
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,170
Let go.

125
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,672
Let go of me!

126
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,007
No!

127
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,801
Get a hold of yourself!

128
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,471
"Brother"?

129
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,681
You think he's your brother?

130
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,309
He's not human.

131
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,564
He's not human anymore.

132
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,486
Get in.

133
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,404
Get her in.

134
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:42,965
Are you ready?

135
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,428
Always.

136
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,306
Now!

137
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,156
Fuck.

138
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,410
You'd better thank me
when I get out of here.

139
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,729
Hey!

140
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,730
Eun-yu!

141
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,674
Let go.

142
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,553
What?

143
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,517
Did the man leave already?

144
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,603
Eun-hyeok.

145
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,357
Do you know the way to the stadium?

146
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,239
Is that all you have to say to me?

147
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,451
Were you waiting for me?

148
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,838
Of course I was!

149
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,550
Aren't you here for me?

150
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,515
Why would I be?

151
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,517
I'll come back.

152
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,062
Don't worry.

153
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,314
I'll come back safe.

154
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,150
You promise?

155
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,319
Yes.

156
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,076
You promised to come back.

157
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,663
How could you not return
when you were alive and well

158
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,790
all this time?

159
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,544
Do you know
how desperately I looked for you?

160
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,046
How could you not come back?

161
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,008
Why did I have to?

162
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,179
You're my brother.

163
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,140
You're my brother.

164
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,479
I've waited all this time.

165
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,775
I missed you every single day.

166
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:53,197
So how could you say that to me?

167
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,744
Was there a good enough reason
for me to find you?

168
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,540
There wasn't.

169
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,459
Am I wrong?

170
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,171
"Brother"?

171
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,173
You think he's your brother?

172
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,759
He's not human.

173
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,470
He's not human anymore.

174
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,111
Tell me if you need anything.

175
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,656
Let me go.

176
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,075
Except for that.

177
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,435
What happened to you?

178
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,027
We had a rather intense lovers' quarrel.

179
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,905
You met Seo Yi-kyung?

180
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,824
I did.

181
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:24,997
But you see…

182
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,583
something's fishy.

183
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,752
You told me

184
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,714
you've never seen her in here.

185
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,845
I know what you're getting at,
but you got it all wrong.

186
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,015
I was stuck in here.

187
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,606
So did you two have a passionate reunion?

188
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,566
We did.

189
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,904
And it was also the last one.

190
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,034
I'm sure you're not here
to deliver a eulogy.

191
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,745
Is it because of your face?

192
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,335
It's absolutely mangled.

193
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,088
Did you figure out what I asked you?

194
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,467
You've spent a year without any progress.

195
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,552
I can't do it overnight.

196
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,646
You need a good reason
for me to keep you alive.

197
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,941
Why haven't you figured it out yet?

198
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,067
Why?!

199
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,321
The trigger.

200
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,953
Let's think about the timing.

201
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,917
I'm talking about your state
when it worked.

202
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,588
At first, you couldn't bear the pain.

203
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,846
Wasn't it the same
when you moved into this body?

204
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,018
Are you suggesting I need to die?

205
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,021
No.

206
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,443
You just need to be on the brink of death.

207
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,529
You know?

208
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,326
I don't have the resources now
to help you like I did before.

209
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,786
I wonder what we can do.

210
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,165
We just need something slightly risky.

211
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,589
Any news of Jae-jin?

212
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,843
Not yet.

213
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,972
Where is he?

214
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,648
Are you all right?

215
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,942
There's no need to delay.

216
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,111
I'm going into my kid's body.

217
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,071
Have you found a way to do it?

218
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,532
Yeah.

219
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,285
You need to help me prepare.

220
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,457
Gi-chun.

221
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,460
The rules are different now.

222
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,253
Well…

223
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,714
Symptomatic people are greater beings now!

224
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,592
I'm not a monster, okay?

225
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,136
I'm one step closer to those people!

226
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,306
Please calm down, Gi-chun.

227
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,682
Where is he?!

228
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,769
I'm symptomatic!

229
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,189
I'm a symptomatic individual!

230
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,157
That's great.

231
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,956
We'll have to confirm a few things,

232
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,793
so stay put for the time being.

233
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,800
You all heard the announcement,
didn't you?

234
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,429
Please cooperate.

235
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,683
Will the symptomatic
really be treated better?

236
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:17,437
- Does this mean they'll live among us now?
- No way.

237
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,522
That's bullcrap.

238
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,274
I'm worried about Gi-chun's kids.

239
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,111
He doesn't have to hide anymore.

240
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,240
Is this a blessing in disguise?

241
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,413
How's the lady?

242
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,085
You mean Seon-hwa?

243
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,214
She's not all there.

244
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,843
She seemed fine for a while,
but she's struggling now.

245
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,304
Do you know a Yeong-jun?

246
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,601
Seon-hwa keeps looking for him,
and she mentioned you,

247
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,770
so I thought you might know him.

248
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,438
I don't.

249
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,382
He's going in.

250
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,676
What should we do, Sarge?

251
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,056
We can't be rash without knowledge
of the situation inside.

252
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,310
We'll sneak in later.

253
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,637
So…

254
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,182
you're badly injured?

255
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,021
He has returned.

256
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,315
Cha Hyun-su.

257
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,526
But I took care of him.

258
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,111
Did you?

259
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,863
Sorry?

260
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:37,494
Did you clearly see him
take his last breath?

261
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,415
No, but he won't be able to escape.

262
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,543
Then answer me this.

263
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,964
Why does it feel like
Cha Hyun-su is still alive?

264
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,014
Cha Hyun-su.

265
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,643
Wait for him.

266
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,648
It's time for him to prove his worth.

267
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,150
His worth?

268
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,821
Then what about you?

269
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,448
Are you even human anymore?

270
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,160
Are you the Eun-hyeok I remember?

271
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,872
I'm a neohuman.

272
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,167
The Eun-hyeok you remember
is no longer human.

273
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,968
So you're telling me you're a neohuman?

274
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,888
Stop with the nonsense!

275
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,143
You expect me to believe that
when I can see you're normal?

276
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,313
It's fine if you don't believe me.

277
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:47,981
I only answered your question.

278
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,399
Let's say you're right.

279
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,110
What exactly is a neohuman?

280
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,905
I'm on the last step of monsterization.

281
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,950
My memories are intact
but not my emotions.

282
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,162
I learn fast, but I don't feel anything.

283
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,457
So you're telling me…

284
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,085
you're not who you used to be?

285
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,717
If you hate me now,
then just be honest about it.

286
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,843
I don't hate you.

287
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:18,970
I don't love you either.

288
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,099
Unlike Cha Hyun-su, you're useless.

289
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,645
You've never done anything worthwhile.

290
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,024
But why look for Eun-hyeok?

291
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,151
He's not even your real brother.

292
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,507
Because I missed you.

293
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,306
You always clung onto me and annoyed me
when I didn't need you.

294
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,103
But I guess you're still the same jerk
you were before.

295
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,606
This conversation is never going to end.

296
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,694
How long is Hyun-su going to take?

297
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,971
Are you sure the medicine in her body
can make someone a special infectee?

298
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,306
It's worked so far,

299
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,934
though I'm not sure
if it's still good to use

300
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,854
as I pulled it from Sang-won's body.

301
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,525
I'm telling you it worked, okay?

302
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,903
The other three were injected too.

303
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,910
Bring her here.

304
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,872
Now is the perfect time.

305
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,957
GENERAL ANESTHETIC

306
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,210
Strike while their leader
is busy with his campfire.

307
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,678
He's going to burn himself?

308
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,513
Crazy, isn't it?

309
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,474
Why didn't I think of this earlier?

310
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:31,936
His body was close to turning,
so it likely has the same weaknesses.

311
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,273
Why is he going so far
just to take over the kid's body?

312
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,109
His current body has a lot of defects.

313
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,904
That's enough questions for now.

314
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,822
Go put her to sleep, and bring her here.

315
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,908
We'll open her up right away.

316
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,328
Come on, hurry.

317
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,747
Are we cleaning or something?

318
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,791
They told us to bring
all the bed sheets and dirty clothes.

319
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,751
What's going on here?

320
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,002
Quiet!

321
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,338
We're not here to play around!

322
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,471
Hey, Gi-chun.

323
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,934
Can't you hear me, baldy?

324
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,103
What the hell do you want now?

325
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,898
Go bring her some food.

326
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,403
That's your job, not mine.

327
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,907
I deserve some rest after what I did.

328
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,369
That kid was caught thanks to me.

329
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,374
I did my part relaying the message, okay?

330
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,588
What's that?

331
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,675
Supplies for the isolation area.

332
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,218
They want you to check it.

333
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,845
Right now?

334
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,597
Hey, are you in there?

335
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,774
What are you doing here?

336
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,110
Why aren't you with your mom?

337
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,239
Are you okay?

338
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,951
Seo Yi-su.

339
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,624
That's my name.

340
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,418
Seo Yi-su?

341
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,712
It's a pretty name.

342
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:04,756
Yeong-su.

343
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,344
I need to go.

344
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,804
My mom told me not to stop.

345
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,099
But I don't know where to go.

346
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,352
You need to get out first.

347
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,229
You can't do anything
if you're stuck in here.

348
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,653
I'll still be alone out there.

349
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,820
No, you won't.

350
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,073
You have me.

351
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,117
You also have Ms. Cha.

352
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,121
Will you go with me?

353
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,039
What?

354
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,250
Then I'll make your wish come true.

355
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,174
Didn't you say…

356
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,302
you wanted to be a monster?

357
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,972
I'm going to become a monster.

358
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,224
And then I'll kill you two.

359
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,559
- What?
- I'm going to kill you all!

360
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,981
I can make it happen.

361
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,050
You're fucking kidding me.

362
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,108
TUNA

363
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,958
Why is that monster…

364
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,635
There's no sign of her escaping
through the main gate.

365
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,970
She must still be here.

366
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,599
I'll make sure to find her.

367
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,018
I'll also help.

368
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,355
And if you do?

369
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,856
How will you keep her around?

370
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:13,069
I don't care if you two
lose your heads or your hands.

371
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,779
But how dare you lose my body?

372
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,573
I was negligent.

373
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,158
Then take responsibility.

374
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:25,289
I'm sorry!

375
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,792
I'll bring her back no matter what.

376
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,420
No.

377
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,884
It's clear to me now
that this is the extent of your abilities.

378
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,138
I knew you were less capable
than Cha Hyun-su,

379
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,390
but I never thought
I'd prefer humans over you.

380
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,018
Gather everyone.

381
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,282
Have you seen Yeong-su?

382
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,450
Is he gone?

383
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,166
Ms. Cha, wait!

384
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,210
We need to find him quickly.

385
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,503
Why?

386
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,884
The Crow Platoon
will start smuggling people out.

387
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:19,760
What?

388
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,597
When? Where to?

389
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,724
I'm not sure yet,

390
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,352
but find him and keep him by your side.

391
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,230
How did you find out?

392
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,232
That's not important.

393
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,735
I'll help you look for him.

394
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,528
Where did you last see him?

395
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,281
The field.

396
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,994
Kim Yeong-su!

397
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,331
Have you seen Yeong-su?

398
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,166
Not today.

399
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,751
Has he gone missing?

400
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,044
- Never mind.
- What?

401
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:59,592
Have you seen a boy about this tall
wearing an orange shirt?

402
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,718
No, I haven't.

403
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,014
All symptomatic individuals and survivors,

404
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,517
please gather
at the central plaza immediately.

405
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,313
Master Sergeant Tak,
please come as soon as possible.

406
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,357
It seems like
they've already caught us out.

407
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,404
All right.

408
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,240
I'll be quick.

409
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,679
I repeat,

410
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,848
all symptomatic individuals and survivors,

411
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,809
please gather at the central plaza now.

412
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,532
Relax.

413
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,160
I want to show my gratitude to you.

414
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,711
Symptomatic individuals

415
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,588
deserve to be treated better.

416
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,050
Congratulations, Master Sergeant Tak.

417
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,555
As I've said before,

418
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,974
symptomatic individuals
will soon become us.

419
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,851
Fifteen days.

420
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,187
Endure just half of a month,

421
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,814
and anyone…

422
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,027
can live a life free from danger

423
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,572
with the power to protect
yourself and your family.

424
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,117
I think it's time to wrap things up.

425
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:51,954
Remember my daughter?

426
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:57,084
She has the power to turn
humans into symptomatic individuals.

427
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,173
But she has wandered off somewhere.

428
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,719
My kid will be a great help to anyone
who wishes to follow me,

429
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,388
so it's best you look for her.

430
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,140
The clock is ticking.

431
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,061
Ms. Cha.

432
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,897
God damn it!

433
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,484
Damn it!

434
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,995
- Dong-jun.
- No worries, sir.

435
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,747
Nothing's changed.

436
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,084
We'll follow your lead, sir.

437
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,679
Our bet isn't over yet.

438
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,351
So please…

439
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,771
get out of there.

440
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,191
Is he dead?

441
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,116
I thought he'd be useful,

442
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,867
but I guess I was wrong.

443
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,160
Watch your mouth.

444
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,332
There's no point in waiting.

445
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,085
Is abandoning people your hobby?

446
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,259
I'm just assessing the situation.

447
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,636
I'm relieved.

448
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,890
I'm relieved to see that you're so normal.

449
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,727
Nothing's changed.

450
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,815
I don't care if you're not human.

451
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,527
I'm not giving up…

452
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,364
on Hyun-su or you.

453
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:14,456
