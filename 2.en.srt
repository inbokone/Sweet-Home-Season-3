ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,976
SWEET HOME

3
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,647
I'm all better now.

4
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,605
Stop.

5
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,859
That won't heal so easily at your age.

6
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,325
How much do you remember?

7
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,120
I had…

8
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,291
a strange dream.

9
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,960
It wasn't a dream.

10
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,007
You had turned into a monster.

11
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,053
But there's no need to worry.

12
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,805
Hyun-su brought you back.

13
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,525
You're human now.

14
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,161
I told you.

15
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,166
Where's Hyun-su?

16
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,346
He's been like that

17
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,806
since he saved you.

18
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,777
We decided to keep watch.

19
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,738
Waking him up now

20
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,990
could be dangerous.

21
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,997
Hyun-su said

22
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,709
he could see the illusions
those who turned were living in.

23
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,212
You said you had a dream.

24
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,881
Was Hyun-su in it?

25
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,551
I heard his voice.

26
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,055
He tried to get a hold of me…

27
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,559
while I kept trying to get away from him.

28
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,860
He told me it wasn't real.

29
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,699
That we had to go back.

30
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,244
That sounds like Hyun-su.

31
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,212
Hey, pretty boy.

32
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,840
How's it coming along?

33
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,302
We'll have no problem driving it.

34
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,469
I see.

35
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,763
Did you find any food?

36
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,648
Where did they go?

37
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,774
Where are they?

38
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,986
I found the food I hid!

39
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,119
By the way,
can we just leave him like that?

40
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,203
Don't worry. He won't die.

41
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,539
Even poisonous mushrooms
barely make him sick.

42
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,875
I see.

43
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,837
What's wrong?

44
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,592
You don't trust me?

45
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,551
No.

46
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,103
How do you know each other?

47
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,646
You don't seem like family.

48
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,402
We're meant to kill each other.

49
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,029
What?

50
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,573
We promised to kill each other
if one of us turned into a monster.

51
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,578
Mom.

52
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:12,872
Dad.

53
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,139
No, stop!

54
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,622
If you ever become a monster,

55
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,041
I'm going to kill you!

56
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,129
Sounds good to me.

57
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,466
I don't want to live as a monster anyway.

58
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,553
If it ever comes to that, just kill me.

59
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:09,887
Okay.

60
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,640
I swear I will.

61
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,601
Keep your word, okay?

62
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,521
Don't change your mind.

63
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:24,986
Eat.

64
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,672
You're up, boss.

65
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,257
What are you doing?

66
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,217
Are you crazy?

67
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,928
That's why you liked me.

68
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,599
You're going to stick with those bastards
who mingle with a monster?

69
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,519
And you did this to me
because I wouldn't let you?

70
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,354
What you won't let me do…

71
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,024
is what I want to do the most.

72
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,320
I have no idea what's gotten into me.

73
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,035
Keep chasing your desires

74
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,746
and you'll end up like your parents.

75
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,392
Hey.

76
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,728
Hey.

77
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,112
Monsters aren't hopeless, you know?

78
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,200
They can turn back into humans.

79
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,412
We've been killing people all this time!

80
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,249
- Stop talking bullshit and uncuff me.
- The others saw it too.

81
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,337
That guy you tried to kill
managed to save her.

82
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,715
What the hell are you doing here,
you half-monster?

83
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,093
Get lost.

84
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,763
Isn't it amazing?

85
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,349
He turned the woman

86
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,351
who had become a monster

87
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,895
back into a human.

88
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:31,862
Give me the key.

89
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,750
Think about what you've done.

90
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,463
Hey.

91
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,384
Uncuff me!

92
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,618
Are you all right?

93
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,164
Come on.

94
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,042
You've seen how stubborn he is.

95
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,589
He might be reckless and obstinate…

96
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,426
but he's soft at heart, so it's okay.

97
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,154
What's the rush?
Hyun-su hasn't even recovered yet.

98
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,533
Tell him I'm grateful.

99
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,287
Tell him yourself.
Stop making me a messenger.

100
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,455
There's no time.

101
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,748
That kid

102
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,334
is going to turn others into monsters too.

103
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,044
Why?

104
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,463
She doesn't trust people.

105
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,091
She thinks they're out to get her.

106
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,550
Do you even know where she is?

107
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,011
We can go find her when Hyun-su wakes up.

108
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,518
She's probably at the stadium.

109
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,645
That's the only place she knows.

110
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,898
This is all my fault.

111
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,194
I need to make it right
before it's too late.

112
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:42,868
Here.

113
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,913
It'll be easier for you
to get around with this.

114
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,766
Yi-kyung left just like that.

115
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,359
I could also walk away
without a second glance if I wanted to.

116
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,622
You know me.

117
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,835
You know how cold I am.

118
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,593
My whole family is.

119
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,058
Think about Eun-hyeok.

120
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,563
He's a cold bastard.

121
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,867
I wonder if he's holding on…

122
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,120
just like you.

123
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,712
Don't give up, Cha Hyun-su.

124
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,511
We're out of gas.

125
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,971
I'll get it refilled.

126
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,312
Did you take care of things?

127
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,022
Yes.

128
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,692
I wish I could believe you.

129
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,360
But you've got quite the history.

130
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,195
Hands off.

131
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,918
So what exactly
is the fruit you mentioned?

132
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,422
I met Seo Yi-kyung.

133
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,265
She broke down, thinking I was dead.

134
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,852
And she was bearing my kid.

135
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,154
I thought I'd give her a gift.

136
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,451
So that I would recognize my kid.

137
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,345
I need that kid.

138
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,555
That kid aside,

139
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,141
if you're looking for Seo Yi-kyung,
you're going to the wrong place.

140
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,977
She won't be at the stadium.

141
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,938
Are you sure?

142
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,443
I can feel that we're getting closer.

143
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,907
We'll meet soon.

144
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,669
These things can't compare
to that kid's perfection.

145
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,466
- What are you doing?
- It's bothering me.

146
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,602
What the hell are you doing?

147
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,062
Do you have a death wish?!

148
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,230
Damn it!

149
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,570
I don't want to die!

150
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,612
Should I kill him?

151
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,905
Not yet.

152
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,470
What was that egg-like thing we saw?

153
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,097
Oh, that was a cocoon.

154
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,348
Cocoon?

155
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,476
You can't quite call it a monster,

156
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,313
but it's something that used to be
a monster but is now entirely new.

157
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,109
Monsters don't attack cocoons.

158
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,112
So you've got to use them to survive.

159
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,531
It's somewhat of a survival tactic.

160
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,784
How do you know they were once monsters?

161
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,369
By opening them up.

162
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,954
Have you done it before?

163
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,414
What do you think?

164
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,167
Surely you have.

165
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,796
It looked like you knew
exactly what you were doing.

166
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:56,885
Anyway,

167
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,055
I think it's time I say goodbye here.

168
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,352
Could you let me off?

169
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,519
How long have you been hiding
that monster?

170
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,986
I'm just checking the facts.

171
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,158
People died,

172
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,994
and I need to hold someone responsible.

173
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,580
"Hold someone responsible"?

174
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,917
You all…

175
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,377
and I…

176
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,090
are no different.

177
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,970
Everyone is going to die
when they get out anyway.

178
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,182
It's not a crime
to give them a head start.

179
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,520
Hold yourselves responsible first
before coming for me.

180
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,775
Explain what that thing is.

181
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,323
At first, we went to the shelter
just like everyone else.

182
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,244
We thought it'd be safe.

183
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,503
Then Hyeon-u started showing symptoms.

184
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,715
But it turned out the soldiers
killed anyone who showed symptoms.

185
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,011
I couldn't let my son be burned alive.

186
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,933
So I hid him here.

187
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,144
Hyeon-u.

188
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,521
Hyeon-u.

189
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,107
It's all right.

190
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,278
It's all right, Hyeon-u.

191
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,946
It's all right.

192
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,366
Our Father in Heaven…

193
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,995
Our Father in Heaven,

194
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,288
hallowed be your name.

195
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,625
Forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.

196
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:35,961
Mom.

197
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,721
Mom.

198
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,889
I'm hungry.

199
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,562
- Don't leave me!
- Hyeon-u.

200
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,359
Mom!

201
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,530
Don't leave me, Mom.

202
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,531
Mom.

203
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,116
Hyeon-u.

204
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,328
I'll…

205
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,456
I'll come back…

206
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,085
I'll come back for you soon.

207
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,302
Jin-uk.

208
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,813
Whenever you cast out
symptomatic individuals,

209
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,107
I brought them back in…

210
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,069
through a way only I knew.

211
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,202
Thank you.

212
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,953
Thank you so much.

213
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,634
If they're going to become monsters…

214
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,930
they might as well serve some purpose.

215
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,516
Were you waiting for some sort of cure?

216
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,145
The emergency management bureau
in Bamseom has collapsed,

217
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,272
and the government has failed us.

218
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,655
Once you become a monster,
there's no coming back.

219
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,618
How foolish of you.

220
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,956
All you did was grow a monster.

221
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,045
So arrogant.

222
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,801
You're so damn arrogant!

223
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,761
Do you think you would be any different?

224
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,473
No parent on earth

225
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,893
can give up on their child

226
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,104
so easily.

227
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,610
I killed my own.

228
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,074
The first monster I killed
when the outbreak hit…

229
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,411
was my own son.

230
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,084
Your son is in a state
we've never seen before.

231
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,213
He hasn't shown signs of aggression yet,

232
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,674
but we can't leave him be.

233
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,973
Your son's removal has been decided.

234
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,933
You have until then to decide

235
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,686
whether you're going to stay here

236
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,355
or leave.

237
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,641
Let go!

238
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,894
You're a coward.

239
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,812
Who says you can die?

240
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,232
You think I'd let you go that easily?

241
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,321
You think you protected him, don't you?

242
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,282
Well, you didn't.

243
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,954
All you did was turn your son
into a murderous monster.

244
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,040
He's been eating people

245
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,585
without even knowing it.

246
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,227
Are we just going to leave it there?

247
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,106
It's Sergeant Tak's orders.

248
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,482
Don't let word get out.

249
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,985
I've never seen
a monster like that before.

250
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:15,031
Do you think that thing
set off the alarm last time?

251
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,408
That seems likely.

252
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,660
It's probably Type Green

253
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,330
since it showed no aggression or reaction.

254
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,873
Then who killed all those people?

255
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,626
There were fifteen or so corpses there.

256
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,006
Any word from Sergeant Kim?

257
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,968
There's no response.

258
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,680
What should we do?

259
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,183
If we don't get a signal by tomorrow,

260
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,269
I'm going to ask Sergeant Tak
for a search operation.

261
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,484
Supply the least amount
of electricity needed

262
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,111
until the power stabilizes.

263
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:02,972
Let go!

264
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:08,019
You're going to get kicked out
like that murderer girl anyway.

265
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,355
So hand it over and get lost!

266
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,774
This place is full of baseballs.

267
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,983
Why take mine?

268
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,069
My brother wants it.

269
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,113
He wants this one.

270
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,662
Watch your backs.

271
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,330
I'm going to get you two!

272
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,707
How?

273
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,668
You don't even have a mom or a dad.

274
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,338
I'm going to become a monster.

275
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,966
And then I'll kill you two.

276
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,134
What?

277
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,760
I'm going to kill you all!

278
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:42,804
You think that scares us?

279
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,852
You're all dead.

280
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,172
Hey, what are you doing there?

281
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,888
My goodness.

282
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,973
That hurts!

283
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,184
Come with me.

284
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,686
Why do you care?

285
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,647
I don't.

286
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,400
Then go mind your own business!

287
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,320
The thing is,

288
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,823
I feel like I need to do something.

289
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,037
Just listen to me for today, okay?

290
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,541
Holy crap! Who's that?

291
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,711
That scared the crap out of me.

292
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,384
Seriously.

293
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,305
How are kids these days
not scared of anything?

294
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,265
Come on.

295
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,438
Hey.

296
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,398
Aren't you coming?

297
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:27,659
Forget it!

298
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,911
You little punk.

299
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,920
You're right. I'm not your mom.

300
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,840
Since you seem to hate me so much,

301
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,591
I'll let you go.

302
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,970
Once you turn 20,

303
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,930
I'm kicking you out.

304
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,265
But just stay until then.

305
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,647
Where's your mom?

306
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,524
Are you alone?

307
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,697
Spend the night here.

308
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,700
I'll help you find your mom tomorrow.

309
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,522
Come back safe.

310
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,234
There's not much time.

311
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,327
Sergeant Tak,
the search team has returned.

312
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,166
But there's only one vehicle.

313
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,882
Damn it.

314
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,475
Why did you return alone?

315
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,186
Well, I'm not alone.

316
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,066
What about my men?

317
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,236
Are they still alive?

318
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:20,915
Open up.

319
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,751
Let's talk face-to-face.

320
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,356
Hey.

321
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:29,942
Are you okay?

322
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,530
I hear…

323
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,450
a sound.

324
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,705
Someone keeps calling me.

325
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,323
Sergeant Tak.

326
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,502
KANG SEOK-CHAN

327
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,588
Are you special infectees?

328
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,468
What game are you playing?

329
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,930
That was my greeting.

330
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:42,932
Greeting?

331
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,521
What do you want?

332
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,224
Wait, that's…

333
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,534
If you want to talk, talk to me.

334
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,247
Why exactly did you come--

335
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,793
What the heck?

336
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,553
Sang-won.

337
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,973
I know you're excited,
but this isn't what we're here for.

338
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,486
Round up all the kids

339
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,988
in one place.

340
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,491
My kid…

341
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,661
is here.

342
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,207
Come with me.

343
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,069
You're lucky things aren't worse.

344
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,738
Where's Sergeant Kim?

345
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,075
Take care of him.

346
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,120
Keep sticking your nose in,

347
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,455
and it won't end well.

348
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,873
You were with him!

349
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,628
Stay still or you'll end up a cripple.

350
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,006
You better not blame me then.

351
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,632
Why did you return alone?

352
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,467
What about Sergeant Kim and the boys?

353
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,011
Why do you keep asking?

354
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,430
What do you think happened

355
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,891
if no one got here before those freaks?

356
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,813
Are they really dead?

357
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,277
Just spare yourselves.

358
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:42,987
All right?

359
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,991
Don't play hero. It won't do you any good.

360
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,106
Hey…

361
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,036
Seok…

362
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,748
Seok-chan…

363
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:38,959
Sarge.

364
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,716
12 HOURS AGO

365
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,510
Stay with me, Sarge.

366
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,889
You're not in a place
to be worried about him.

367
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,103
Help.

368
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,193
Please, Dr. Lim.

369
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,323
KANG SEOK-CHAN
BLOOD TYPE: AB

370
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,243
KIM YEONG-HU
BLOOD TYPE: AB

371
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,494
You're in luck.

372
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,418
What are you doing?

373
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,338
I'm trying to save the one
with slightly better odds.

374
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,552
It's too late for him.

375
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,469
No.

376
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,638
It's not too late.

377
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,723
I can't save you both.

378
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,566
I'm the one…

379
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,694
who won't make it.

380
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,866
No…

381
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,286
No…

382
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,371
Sarge.

383
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,584
You have to pull yourself together

384
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,086
and get back on your feet.

385
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,845
There are more survivors
like Yong-seok here.

386
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,766
I know this is a lot to ask
at a time like this…

387
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,646
but please don't abandon them.

388
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,526
I wish I could've helped you.

389
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,447
I'm sorry…

390
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,408
for how things turned out.

391
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:06,899
Seok-chan…

392
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,029
Seok-chan…

393
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,910
Kang Seok-chan!

394
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,457
Seok-chan!

395
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,809
Greetings, survivors at the stadium.

396
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:47,439
Here are some rules to follow
for a more comfortable and easy stay.

397
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,025
We ask for your cooperation

398
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,152
so we may all have a happy ending.

399
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,446
The Crow Platoon

400
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,575
will be treated equally as the survivors.

401
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:02,329
The ban on entering and leaving
will remain in effect,

402
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,540
but no additional restrictions
will be placed.

403
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:10,129
However, symptomatic individuals
will be offered more favorable conditions.

404
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,842
The previously mentioned rules
do not apply to symptomatic individuals.

405
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,261
You are free to move about

406
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,140
and live your life as you please.

407
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,810
You no longer need to hide.

408
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,230
Monsterization

409
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,775
is the first step in your transformation…

410
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,905
into neohumans of a new age.

411
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,753
How much longer?

412
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,053
Five days.

413
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,056
You're doing a great job
not letting the monster take control.

414
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,267
Are those people
test subjects from Bamseom?

415
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,645
That's right.

416
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,313
I created them.

417
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,987
I told you you'd need my help.

418
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,120
There's something you don't know.

419
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,166
I'm not saying I'm going to
treat your monsterization.

420
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,460
I'm going to help you fight it.

421
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:35,964
You know those special infectees?

422
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,257
I can turn you into one.

423
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:41,220
If you go down,
this whole place will fall apart.

424
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,473
Didn't you say
you wanted to protect this place?

425
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,058
So?

426
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,103
Did you find it?

427
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,069
I brought it with me.

428
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:01,615
It's a very special medicine
that can turn you into a special infectee.

429
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,617
But the thing is…

430
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,539
it's quite tricky to retrieve it.

431
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,062
Uncuff me.

432
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,486
I get you now, okay?

433
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,739
I'll go my own way.

434
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,574
No.

435
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:32,080
Didn't you make up your mind
to stick with them?

436
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:32,998
I did.

437
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,085
Come with us.

438
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,632
You're the only person I can whine to.

439
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,892
You'll end up dead.

440
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,524
I'm not saying they're evil.

441
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,568
But as you know…

442
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,655
that's how monsterization is.

443
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,615
You're so stubborn.

444
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,163
They were human.

445
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,173
What's wrong?

446
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,093
Are you still dizzy?

447
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,889
You need an antidote?

448
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,558
Yeah.

449
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,645
Nothing used to faze you.

450
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,939
You're past your prime.

451
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:39,856
Ha-ni.

452
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,234
Get it for me tomorrow.

453
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,988
- Wait for the sun.
- Why?

454
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,322
It's too late right now.

455
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:48,949
Go tomorrow.

456
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,357
- Kill us.
- Kill us all.

457
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,526
- Come on.
- Kill us all.

458
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,237
You know you want to.

459
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,239
Kill them all.

460
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,450
- Kill them.
- For fuck's sake.

461
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,573
It wasn't only monsters you killed.

462
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,409
You hate people too.

463
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,662
Just die.

464
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,020
You should eat.

465
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,871
What will you do when Hyun-su wakes up?

466
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,127
He says he's not

467
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,295
who you're looking for.

468
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:10,882
None of your business.

469
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,677
Just like me,

470
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,388
he can't get into the stadium.

471
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,141
He'll get kicked out.

472
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,242
I got the antidote.

473
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,120
Boss?

474
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,013
Get out.

475
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,348
Snap out of it!

476
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,727
Please wake him up.

477
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:46,686
Are you kidding me?

478
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,647
Get yourself together!

479
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,148
He can do it again, can't he?

480
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:54,110
He can turn a monster
back into a human, can't he?

481
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,946
Answer me, Eun-yu.

482
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,614
That's what you told me.

483
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,325
Please…

484
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,285
What are you saying? Who else…

485
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,649
Monsters might swarm in.

486
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:33,733
We need to move!

487
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,532
I can wake him up.
I'm bringing him with me.

488
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,284
Lee Eun-yu!

489
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,404
Stop.

490
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,497
Get it together.

491
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,001
Come on.

492
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,920
Wang Ho-sang!

493
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,258
Can you hear me?

494
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,430
You can hear me, right?

495
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:31,393
Let's hold on

496
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,312
for just a bit more.

497
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,235
Please hold on.

498
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:43,780
Kill me.

499
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,868
If you ever become a monster,

500
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,787
I'm going to kill you!

501
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,289
I don't want to live as a monster anyway.

502
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,208
If it ever comes to that, just kill me.

503
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,087
Keep your word, okay?

504
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,509
You kill me.

505
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,856
Why do you keep me around
if you hate people so much?

506
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,483
I liked how you didn't glow.

507
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,028
It doesn't matter if we're empty shells.

508
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,864
What matters…

509
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:28,533
is that we're alive.

510
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,152
Kill me.

511
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,151
What are you doing?

512
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,030
Let go!

513
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,033
Let go of me.

514
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,368
Boss!

515
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,747
Why are you doing this?

516
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,750
I should've…

517
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,418
I should've done it.

518
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,087
I should've killed you.

519
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,882
You didn't have to go that far.

520
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,386
Boss!

521
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,304
Boss!

522
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,182
Why are you doing this?

523
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,813
Let go!

524
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,524
Boss!

525
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,276
Boss!

526
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,237
Why?

527
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,616
No!

528
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:17,869
Hyun-su…

529
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,997
Cha Hyun-su.

530
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,248
Wake up.

531
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,541
We need to get out.

532
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,834
Cha Hyun-su!

533
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,212
Please wake up, Cha Hyun-su!

534
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:30,715
Open your eyes.

535
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,301
Please open your eyes, Hyun-su!

536
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,208
Hey, you bastard!

537
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,669
Come at me!

538
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,546
Come on, you damn monster!

539
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,674
Bring it on!

540
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,269
Come here!

541
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,482
Come at me!

542
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,364
Where are you going?

543
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,575
Answer me, Cha Hyun-su!

544
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,078
Come at me!

545
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,687
Please don't go.

546
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,522
Don't go.

547
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,108
Keep it down, will you?

548
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,000
I told you to keep it down.

549
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,184
Cha Hyun-su.

550
01:06:56,846 --> 01:07:01,851
