ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,976
SWEET HOME

3
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,998
It's time for some fun.

4
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,358
Why the fuck am I doing this?

5
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,278
Are you one of us?

6
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,406
You don't look familiar.

7
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,627
I'm no pathetic lab rat like you losers.

8
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,344
How could you not remember this face?

9
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,389
Are you still looking for friends?

10
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,855
So how many do you have now?

11
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,322
Cha Hyun-su?

12
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,450
I see you remember now.

13
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,037
Put that down.

14
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:51,916
This?

15
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,982
I never said you could take it back.

16
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,990
Where's Jung Ui-myeong?

17
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,285
Where's that bastard hiding?

18
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,461
The stadium!

19
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,588
It's nearby.

20
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,132
He was barely alive back then.

21
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,134
How is he now?

22
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,429
Get out of my head!

23
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,475
I shouldn't have taken this body.

24
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,727
Why the fuck isn't it working?

25
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,482
It seemed like
he was trapped in that body.

26
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,235
He'll make it out soon.

27
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,446
I guess that's enough.

28
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,324
I'll go see him for myself.

29
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,215
Kill me!

30
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,175
Just kill me!

31
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,554
I will.

32
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,852
Just kill me!

33
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,290
Sergeant Tak, the main gate…

34
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,750
Some people are at the gate.

35
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,961
They look like scraps.

36
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,841
We're here to find our kin.

37
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,930
We promise not to cause any harm.

38
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,018
We only seek to find our kin.

39
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,939
Aren't you sick and tired of
looking for this kin of yours?

40
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,787
What happened to not killing anyone?

41
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,459
I said I wouldn't kill humans.

42
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,421
What were they,

43
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,006
if not humans?

44
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,592
You become ignorant about the world
when you lock yourself up.

45
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,848
You want to know what they are?

46
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,727
The outside world is filled with them.

47
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,506
Don't worry about those worthless scraps.

48
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,445
I should keep my promise.

49
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,657
You deserve a reward
for what you showed me.

50
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,952
What would you like?

51
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,754
Hand it over.

52
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,260
Who are you?

53
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,637
Hey, she's…

54
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,400
Give me those too.

55
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,112
But these are mine.

56
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,862
It's okay.

57
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,906
You're okay.

58
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,824
Mom?

59
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,183
Why are you…

60
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,269
still human?

61
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,148
I turned you into a monster.

62
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,529
Do you want me to be a monster?

63
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:38,989
Yeah.

64
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,533
Why?

65
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,494
Because I don't have to hate you.

66
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,831
Do you…

67
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,419
hate me?

68
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,258
I thought you hated me.

69
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,301
Mom…

70
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,763
Why did you do it?

71
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,182
That's why I locked you up.
It was for your own sake.

72
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,435
To stop you from doing this again!

73
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,020
You hate being with me.

74
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,774
I'm a nuisance and I scare you.

75
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,485
Don't you hate me because I'm a monster?

76
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,159
I thought you'd understand me…

77
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,079
if you were also a monster.

78
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,678
I don't hate you.

79
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,531
I tried to ignore

80
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,577
the fact that you were different
and special.

81
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,374
I didn't want to accept it.

82
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,462
Why not?

83
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,469
I was scared.

84
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,350
I let my greed take over me.

85
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:33,812
I'm sorry.

86
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,365
This place is too crowded and dangerous.

87
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,785
I want to start
a new life with you outside.

88
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,162
Do you

89
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,873
want to come with me?

90
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,753
What do you say?

91
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,677
I'm not sure.

92
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,601
Think about it.

93
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,358
If you want to give me another chance…

94
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,779
meet me here.

95
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,409
I'll wait for you.

96
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,060
What brings you here?

97
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,980
You already know
no one is allowed outside.

98
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,859
Were you trying to escape?

99
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,868
Come to think of it,
your uniform looks familiar.

100
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,330
There were about four of them.

101
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,207
You shouldn't have

102
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,209
sent them to Bamseom.

103
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,130
It's time to take off your uniform.

104
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,634
And stop sticking your nose
in other people's business.

105
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,137
Live quietly like the others.

106
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,807
- You asshole!
- Lee Dong-jun.

107
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,517
- Get back in.
- Sergeant Tak!

108
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,643
He's not going anywhere.

109
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,105
Violators must be punished.

110
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,524
Ja-yeong,

111
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,734
make things right.

112
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,340
Sergeant Tak!

113
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,347
You said symptomatic individuals
are free to move about.

114
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,526
Are we good now?

115
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,584
How did it go?

116
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,212
Sergeant Tak is symptomatic.

117
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,567
I thought I'd be locked up forever.

118
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,403
Why were you in there?

119
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,365
Let's just say I was overzealous.

120
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,285
Anyway,

121
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,580
there's only one reason why you'd be here.

122
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,834
I told the special infectees
that I'm symptomatic.

123
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,379
We need to act
while their guards are down.

124
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,508
That's good news.

125
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,261
Do you remember what I told you?

126
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,306
A small cut won't be enough.

127
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,310
You need to kill them while they're weak.

128
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,230
So you're saying

129
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,733
I need to face at least one of them
in my current state, correct?

130
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,778
I told you it wouldn't be easy.

131
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,738
But it's better than being hopeless.

132
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,700
These things are everywhere outside.

133
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,040
It's unbelievable.

134
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,584
Those bastards

135
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,380
can't seem to leave these things alone.

136
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,714
I wonder why that is.

137
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,217
What do these things do?

138
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,902
Good job waiting patiently.

139
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,031
Most people don't listen at all.

140
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,455
I've seen many die running away.

141
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,923
You must be different.

142
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,718
You were a great help at Bamseom.

143
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,095
Thanks to you, I'm back.

144
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,974
I saw you take your last breath.

145
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,145
There's a lot we don't know
about each other, isn't there?

146
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,149
What are you?

147
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,902
Are you a mutated monster?

148
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,695
No.

149
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,448
Then do you control the monsters?

150
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,244
Let's just say I communicate with them.

151
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,996
Stick close to me.

152
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,426
You asked me what I am.

153
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,097
Neohuman.

154
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,766
That's what we call ourselves.

155
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,356
It's a peace offering.

156
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,151
I thought it might
benefit our relationship.

157
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,076
What's with that cocoon-like thing?

158
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,747
It's the heart.

159
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,168
When we return to the heart, we're reborn.

160
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,296
I was symptomatic…

161
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,050
and went through monsterization.

162
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,763
I was once a human like you,

163
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,307
but then I was born again.

164
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,981
Three more days, is it?

165
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,986
Things might work out this time,
so hold on.

166
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,531
Never mind that.

167
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,745
What are these?

168
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:53,997
Right.

169
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:55,957
Scraps.

170
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,920
Some strange bastards came to me
when I was in Bamseom.

171
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,593
They pestered me about finding something,

172
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,346
so I killed them all.

173
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,184
But I found out they became cocoons…

174
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,687
and were reborn.

175
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,070
Reborn?

176
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,697
Then I can just kill them again.

177
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,119
The endless torture they face
right after being reborn

178
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,705
would eventually make them give up.

179
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,795
So these things will be reborn and…

180
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,838
No, I mean…

181
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,135
So monsters turn into…

182
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,096
immortal humans?

183
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,278
They were looking for kin.

184
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,449
It seems you're hiding something from us.

185
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,084
Those bastards
can find each other effortlessly.

186
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,673
I've never seen them before.

187
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,136
- If you do--
- I'll take care of it and let you know.

188
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,143
They ruined the natural order.

189
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,439
The special infectees?

190
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,484
They know

191
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,446
that we're the most vulnerable
in the heart.

192
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,949
So why did they lock you up?

193
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,870
They could've killed you
when you were in the heart.

194
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,331
They were looking for

195
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,417
a quicker way to kill us all.

196
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,170
They wanted to know…

197
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,381
where we call home.

198
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,803
The special infectees are at the stadium.

199
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,015
Why go there
if they're looking for your home?

200
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,227
They must have another reason.

201
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,563
You keep saying "we."

202
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,942
Are there a lot of neohumans like you?

203
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,571
Imagine how many humans
turned into monsters.

204
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,200
It's just a matter of time

205
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,661
before everyone becomes a neohuman.

206
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,335
Now lead me to the stadium.

207
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,255
Tell me what the special infectees
are afraid of.

208
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,424
Neohumans.

209
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,803
Beings like me.

210
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,754
Is your family there too?

211
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,965
At the stadium or whatever?

212
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,970
No, I've lost contact with them.

213
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,265
So why go back?

214
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,643
You don't even have a family there.

215
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,355
I have nowhere else to go.

216
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,234
And it's honestly not that bad.

217
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,819
So just stick with me.

218
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,951
Did you just propose to me?

219
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,204
Are you saying you'll take care of me?

220
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,708
No, I mean…

221
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,175
Here comes the killjoy.

222
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,468
She's back early.

223
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,267
What's wrong?

224
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,104
Where's Hyun-su?

225
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,795
What's so funny?

226
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,922
Let me in on the fun.

227
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:59,135
I feel bad that you don't know
you're going to die.

228
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,180
You feel bad for me and not yourself?

229
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,682
When he gets his hands on you,

230
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,143
you'll die for real this time.

231
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,898
He won't take it easy on you anymore.

232
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,447
That experiment must've
gotten to your head.

233
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,366
You're talking nonsense.

234
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,202
I'll show you

235
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,454
just how weak…

236
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,290
the man you respect is.

237
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,670
Could I actually wake him up?

238
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,094
I never had a chance to begin with.

239
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,141
Are you just going to let him go then?

240
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,017
You barely found him.

241
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,656
What are you doing?

242
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,699
Let go. I need to go.

243
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,409
Go where?

244
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,326
The stadium.

245
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,871
That's where Hyun-su is going.

246
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,038
Everyone is in danger.

247
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,875
He might kill them all!

248
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,343
Can you walk?

249
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,013
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

250
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,182
I'll explain on the way.

251
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,364
Why did you turn down his offer?

252
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,118
Not many of us are left in this world.

253
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,038
You don't need to care about humans.

254
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,289
That's not why.

255
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,419
I'm doing this
purely out of my personal interest.

256
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,840
I only act to benefit Cha Hyun-su.

257
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,887
You bastards are just unlucky
to get on my bad side.

258
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,558
Look at it this way.

259
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,146
It's only natural for the powerful
to mess with the weak.

260
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,413
That son of a bitch.

261
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,396
I saw you do it.

262
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,857
We're quick learners.

263
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,530
Immortal and intelligent?

264
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,450
What will you use all that power for?

265
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,788
Gather other neohumans
born from the heart.

266
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,249
That's it.

267
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,084
Otherwise, I just exist.

268
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,338
Answer me this.

269
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,801
What happens to
all your past memories as a human?

270
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,469
That's not important.

271
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,267
We've achieved everything we need to

272
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,352
by transcending monsterization.

273
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,893
My mom came back.

274
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,522
I thought she abandoned me.

275
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,068
I thought she hated me.

276
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,821
But she came here for me.

277
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,743
I never wanted to see her again.

278
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,871
But once I did,

279
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,290
it made me want to go with her.

280
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,962
But if I do…

281
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,465
will I ever see…

282
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,678
Yeong-su again?

283
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,012
When are you leaving?

284
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,103
Were you not going to say goodbye?

285
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,439
Go with your mom.

286
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,941
You said she's waiting for you.

287
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,819
I can't see my mom ever again.

288
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,155
She's dead.

289
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,076
That's why Ms. Cha is like my mom now.

290
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,620
You should go to yours.

291
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,749
I'm not sure.

292
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,876
You're lying. You know you want to.

293
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,254
Then you can ask her your name too.

294
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,056
You left this here, didn't you?

295
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,058
Yeah, it's yours.

296
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,727
You know what this is?

297
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,568
This is my sister's.

298
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,864
KIM SU-YEONG

299
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,909
It's an award given to a person
who protected someone well.

300
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,039
You have to look after each other, okay?

301
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,354
You should take it.

302
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,236
Why?

303
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,281
You'll be gone forever,

304
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,283
so you can have it.

305
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,148
What's wrong?

306
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,691
Did you change your mind?

307
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,487
No, I still want to go.

308
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,488
That's why I'm here.

309
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,200
Then what's wrong?

310
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,955
I have a question.

311
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,917
Do I also…

312
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,419
have a name?

313
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,007
I heard that all living things have names.

314
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,175
So do I also--

315
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,057
Of course you have a name.

316
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,101
Why wouldn't you?

317
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,733
Really?

318
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,109
What is it?

319
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,111
Yi-kyung.

320
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,929
I missed you.

321
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,060
Are you shocked at how different I look?

322
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,188
I would be too.

323
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,734
But you should understand.

324
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,530
You saw how my body…

325
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,449
was in complete ruins.

326
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,830
Nam Sang-won is dead.

327
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,584
And yet I'm still standing here…

328
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,297
remembering who you are.

329
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,927
I moved from body to body…

330
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,057
and went to Green Home
all in search of you.

331
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,735
I missed you.

332
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,947
I missed you, Yi-kyung.

333
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:47,676
Run!

334
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,022
Go!

335
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,830
Why didn't you just fall for it?

336
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:19,727
Let go!

337
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,286
Look, Yi-kyung.

338
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,331
She's our kid.

339
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,877
You crazy bastard.

340
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,714
Thank you, Yi-kyung.

341
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,426
For giving me this gift.

342
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,444
Take mine.

343
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,405
Just take mine.

344
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,327
If you need a body, take mine.

345
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,286
Please.

346
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,581
You lost all value
once you gave birth to this kid.

347
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,377
I only left you alive then because of her!

348
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,880
You've done your part.

349
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,384
Now it's time to die.

350
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,453
You need to go, Yi-su.

351
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,875
Is that my name?

352
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,339
Seo Yi-su.

353
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,344
I'm sorry I took so long…

354
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,389
to call you by your name.

355
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:22,975
I'm so sorry.

356
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,490
Go.

357
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,117
Go.

358
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,495
Go…

359
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,084
Go, Yi-su.

360
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,463
Yi-su…

361
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,510
Mom.

362
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:00,763
Mom…

363
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,900
Mom…

364
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,196
Mom!

365
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,031
Please.

366
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,367
No!

367
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,285
Please…

368
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,456
Mom!

369
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:29,443
