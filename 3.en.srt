ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,976
SWEET HOME

3
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:11,905
GENERAL ANESTHETIC

4
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,452
Is this all you've got?

5
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,749
Then just die.

6
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:44,813
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,026
I'm so sorry.

8
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,494
I can't give up on you like this.

9
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,812
NEOHUMAN

10
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,361
MONSTERIZATION IS NOT THE END

11
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,447
ACCEPT IT AND YOU SHALL SEE THE TRUTH

12
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,265
Please kill me.

13
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,603
What was that announcement?

14
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,314
Does it have to do with you letting me go?

15
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,318
Four outsiders have arrived.

16
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,155
They seem to be able to
resist monsterization.

17
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,244
One year ago,

18
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,914
you hid yourself here with your family

19
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,293
when you found out
about your son's monsterization.

20
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,338
When you smuggled
all those survivors in here,

21
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,843
you must've known
you'd get caught at some point.

22
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,096
What were you thinking
when you took them in?

23
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,476
Isn't it obvious?

24
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,480
It was dangerous outside.

25
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,233
It was obvious they'd die…

26
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,612
if I didn't let them in.

27
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,699
Then help them one last time.

28
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,662
Where's the exit
through the unverified area?

29
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,958
Are you going to run away?

30
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,338
I'm trying to help the survivors
once more.

31
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,786
How annoying.

32
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,852
Ms. Seo Yi-kyung?

33
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,994
You're still alive.

34
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,790
Just answer my questions.

35
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,044
Is this about Sang-won?

36
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,754
What do you think?

37
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,383
He isn't dead yet.

38
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,515
You don't believe me?

39
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,854
Your husband's here to look for your kid.

40
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,777
Cut the crap.

41
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,322
He's dead.

42
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,579
Were you actually pregnant?

43
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,832
I'm sure your kid wasn't normal.

44
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,211
The father being a monster
must've had an effect.

45
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,089
Is your kid normal?

46
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,179
So that's why you're looking for your kid.

47
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,019
You don't have time.

48
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,771
Get to your kid before your husband does.

49
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,941
Who knows what he'll do?

50
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,134
You did that!

51
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,095
You killed him!

52
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,933
How dare you speak of him?

53
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,935
I'm telling the truth!

54
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,645
I told you then.

55
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,272
He wasn't in a state to speak.

56
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,440
He's dead.

57
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,277
I saw it with my own eyes.

58
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,738
You think I'm lying?

59
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,783
I couldn't believe it either.

60
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,578
But I'm telling you he's alive.

61
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,625
And he looks completely different.

62
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,238
What brings you here?

63
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,784
Is this where you've been staying?

64
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,161
Yeah, as you can see.

65
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,039
Enough of the pleasantries.

66
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,502
It's time for you
to repay me for your life.

67
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,009
That's a harsh thing to say
to your old friend.

68
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,511
You're still alive, aren't you?

69
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,931
I've done my duty to you.

70
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,851
What else could I even help you with
at this point?

71
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,896
There's something
that's been bothering me.

72
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,609
Then I'll help you however I can.

73
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,116
By the way, Sang-won.

74
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,620
Don't you wonder about Seo Yi-kyung?

75
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,580
She's the mother of your kid.

76
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,624
I told you I already met her.

77
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,422
Several times, at that.

78
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,801
I realized when my memory recovered

79
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,889
why I had gone…

80
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,477
to Green Home.

81
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,318
I didn't know she was Yi-kyung then.

82
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,329
But perhaps I wanted to see her.

83
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,594
What about now?

84
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,556
I'm glad I didn't kill her then.

85
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,018
Thanks to that,
I'll be able to meet my kid.

86
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,151
Let's say Yi-kyung
managed to survive and give birth.

87
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,446
The kid wouldn't even be a year old yet.

88
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,200
There aren't any kids that young here.

89
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,246
How are you so certain
you'll find your kid here?

90
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,623
She was almost due

91
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,751
the last time I saw her.

92
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,005
Are you saying the baby grew that quickly

93
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,633
and was born within a matter of hours?

94
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,385
That doesn't make sense.

95
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,225
I brought forth that life.

96
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,567
It will become
the most perfect being soon.

97
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,994
And it will be my next host.

98
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,543
I need you to find a way
for me to leave this body.

99
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:44,180
- Out of the way.
- Excuse me.

100
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,556
- Coming through.
- Move aside.

101
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,689
Cowards.

102
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,194
By the way, what's your name?

103
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,613
I'm Kim Yeong-su.

104
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,699
I don't know.

105
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,576
You don't know your name?

106
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,204
What's a name?

107
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,500
What does your mom call you?

108
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,631
She's never called me anything.

109
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,884
I doubt it.

110
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,803
All living things have names.

111
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,057
Let me know when you find out.

112
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,892
I'll call you by your name.

113
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,770
Okay.

114
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,855
You could also just make one up.

115
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,649
It's not that hard.

116
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,460
I told you I'm not a liar.

117
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,256
Were you happy to see him?

118
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,511
What did he mean by leaving his body?

119
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,516
Sang-won is capable
of taking over other bodies.

120
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,772
It seems he's trying to occupy
the body of a more perfect being.

121
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,316
Unfortunately for you,

122
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,402
his target is your kid.

123
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,907
How do you kill a special infectee?

124
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,451
Sang-won isn't alone.

125
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,996
Even if there was a way,
it wouldn't be easy.

126
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,790
- How do I do it?
- You can never kill him.

127
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,669
You know he's no match for mere mortals.

128
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,094
What do you think you're doing?

129
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,430
Open the door.

130
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,390
It seems I won't be getting any answers.

131
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,812
Cha Hyun-su.

132
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,189
A fellow MH could do it.

133
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,735
Is that the only way?

134
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,279
Yeah, so open up.

135
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,410
He's your dear husband. You won't kill him
even if you know the way.

136
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,705
You can't. Now open this door.

137
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,959
Nam Sang-won is dead.

138
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:24,882
Open the door!

139
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,442
Mister.

140
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,743
Is it her?

141
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,500
Is he going to leave us alone now?

142
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,844
It can't be.

143
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,262
Is she…

144
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,598
the monster?

145
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,039
Do you…

146
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,042
need me?

147
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,589
Yeah.

148
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,217
I've been waiting for you.

149
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,730
You grew up so well.

150
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,979
Master Sergeant Tak
hasn't given us orders yet.

151
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,730
We can't do anything rash.

152
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,193
We need to see
what those bastards are up to.

153
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,988
We can't just sit by and watch.

154
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,823
They won't just let us be.

155
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,437
Get up.

156
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,105
A monster is in here.

157
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,483
It's all right.

158
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,402
I just need to get back to the heart.

159
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,487
Heart?

160
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,867
Don't mess with me.

161
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,244
Mind your own business now.

162
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,705
I didn't bring you here
just to watch you kill yourself.

163
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,708
There's much more you don't know.

164
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,762
Those special infectees
did this to you, didn't they?

165
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,684
Why did they keep you locked up
instead of killing you?

166
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,230
Perhaps I knew something
they wanted to know.

167
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,231
And what's that?

168
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,484
What they fear the most.

169
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,155
Wait and you'll find out.

170
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,660
As long as you stay here,

171
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,495
you'll be safe.

172
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,915
What on earth--

173
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,740
Wait and you'll find out.

174
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,950
As long as you stay here,

175
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,952
you'll be safe.

176
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,676
What's that?

177
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,554
Anesthetic.

178
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,767
How long do you think
you can keep that up?

179
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,271
I haven't thought about it.

180
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,773
Lee Eun-yu.

181
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,610
You shouldn't have woken him up.

182
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,278
I'm too exhausted to argue.

183
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,488
Then just listen.

184
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,203
As soon as he opened his eyes,

185
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,330
he tried to kill the monster and me.

186
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,916
He's not the man
who saved that woman anymore.

187
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,253
I get that Hyun-su is in there somewhere.

188
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,295
But the thing is,

189
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,423
only he can save himself.

190
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,552
We can't bring him back.
He's been consumed by the monster!

191
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,138
If he had fully turned into a monster,

192
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,932
then I'd admit you're right.

193
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,434
But I saw him come back.

194
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,062
Knowing that, how can I…

195
00:23:59,146 --> 00:23:59,980
Eun-yu.

196
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,065
If you don't stop…

197
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,319
you could really die.

198
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,197
Abandoning families
and killing loved ones…

199
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,200
is what monsterization does to you.

200
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,245
If you also end up dead…

201
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,583
I can't leave him behind.

202
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,253
I owe him.

203
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,924
And he's the only reason
we're still alive right now.

204
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,928
Let's think about it.

205
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,961
Boss.

206
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,423
I'm sorry I broke our promise.

207
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,931
I know we promised…

208
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,023
to kill each other
if one of us turned into a monster.

209
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,192
I'm sorry for backing out.

210
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,907
I'm sorry…

211
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,997
for being stubborn…

212
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,001
and lying to you.

213
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,256
And…

214
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,140
I'm sorry for abandoning you.

215
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,438
I'm sorry…

216
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,280
for wanting to live again.

217
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,209
You heard me, didn't you?

218
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,215
Wang Ho-sang!

219
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,636
You heard me call your name, didn't you?

220
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,020
You put up the best fight you could…

221
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,567
and died a winner.

222
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,908
I'll try to be like you.

223
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,139
Ha-ni.

224
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:12,982
Live a good life.

225
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,582
I will.

226
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,991
So what's the plan now?

227
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,662
We'll go to the stadium.

228
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,205
What?

229
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,957
Don't worry.

230
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,751
We won't go inside.

231
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,213
Yi-kyung should've arrived by now.

232
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,509
If we leave now, we can meet her outside.

233
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,052
What about you?

234
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,139
You know life in there
wasn't exactly paradise for me.

235
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,644
Hyun-su and Yi-kyung
have lived together until now.

236
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,440
I want to join them.

237
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,027
It's the right thing to do.

238
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,739
You and I need to go our own ways now.

239
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,825
What about Hyun-su?

240
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,620
You can't take him in that state.

241
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,008
Who's going where?

242
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,887
You don't need to know.

243
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,932
You go where I go.

244
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,863
You can't kill me, can you?

245
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,367
It's not that you're sparing me.

246
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,161
You just can't kill me.

247
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:31,871
What?

248
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,123
You're confused right now.

249
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,378
You thought you could do
anything you want, but you can't.

250
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,713
Am I wrong?

251
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,091
That's enough.

252
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,551
Cha Hyun-su.

253
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,553
Come with me.

254
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,430
You've got time, don't you?

255
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,565
Please come with me, Hyun-su.

256
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,574
Interesting.

257
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,161
I've woken up exactly three times,

258
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,832
and you were there each time.

259
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:17,750
Cha Hyun-su.

260
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,136
I wonder why you stayed.

261
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,054
I was waiting for you.

262
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,891
Waiting for me?

263
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,268
Or Cha Hyun-su?

264
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,648
How about this?

265
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,235
I'm going to make sure
Hyun-su doesn't wake up.

266
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,988
You do the opposite.

267
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,198
You have three days.

268
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,868
If you succeed,

269
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,621
I'll let him go.

270
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,291
You mean that?

271
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,587
You'll find out eventually.

272
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,843
Wherever it is, lead the way.

273
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,720
I'll follow.

274
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,530
What's this?

275
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,324
- Carry it.
- Why should I?

276
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,492
You agreed to come,

277
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,577
so you need to help.

278
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,875
Are you coming with us?

279
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,419
Good choice.

280
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,464
It's not fun being a lone ranger.

281
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,341
I'm speaking from experience.

282
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,353
Anytime now.

283
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,834
We finally meet.

284
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,423
Let me introduce myself.

285
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,050
I'm…

286
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,469
your dad.

287
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,847
Dad?

288
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,267
What's that?

289
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,227
It means I created you.

290
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,521
Did your mom not tell you?

291
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,902
It seems there's a lot to talk about.

292
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,157
We're going to stay here
for the time being.

293
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:55,992
This…

294
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,244
is your playground.

295
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,497
You can do whatever you want.

296
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,499
Whatever I want?

297
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,710
Of course.

298
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,463
But tell me this.

299
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,214
Why are you alone?

300
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,175
Where's your mom?

301
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,186
Is she dead?

302
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:25,938
She's a monster now.

303
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,863
I'm sorry to hear that.

304
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,157
From now on,

305
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,534
I'll take care of you.

306
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,273
It seems like

307
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,818
there's been an escape from Bamseom.

308
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,988
She said she'd handle it,

309
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,824
so I trusted her.

310
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,451
I should've made sure.

311
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,965
Station her by the main gate.

312
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,676
When those soldiers return…

313
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,595
kill them all.

314
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,351
This time, everyone will watch you.

315
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,718
Don't get caught tailing them.

316
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,762
I know I don't need to,
but it's hard not to worry.

317
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,472
About what?

318
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,143
He found his kid
and just needs to take over her body.

319
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,437
There can't be any unexpected problems.

320
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,981
And it's unclear who that kid is.

321
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,691
Just keep an eye on them.

322
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:35,943
Got it.

323
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,514
Go back.

324
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,352
You're very pretty, sweetie.

325
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,770
I don't want to kill you.

326
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,813
So just go back.

327
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,235
Don't do what you don't want to.

328
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,529
Life is short enough as it is.

329
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,949
That's why I'm leaving.

330
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,453
The gate is open, so I need to go home.

331
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,833
My goodness!

332
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,919
What are you doing?

333
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,712
Just let me go!

334
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,172
Please!

335
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,883
That hurts!

336
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,306
Why are you upset?

337
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,935
Is it because of that kid?

338
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,897
That man was Sang-wook, right?

339
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,069
Is he really her dad?

340
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,991
Does that mean she's leaving us?

341
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,496
Probably.

342
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,873
That sucks.

343
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,057
Aren't you two close?

344
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,143
Look after her, won't you?

345
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,437
She tried to escape.

346
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,354
What?

347
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,318
Are you crazy?
Why would you try to escape?

348
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,862
I thought I could go back home
if the gate opened.

349
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,488
That's what Ms. Cha said.

350
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,034
You've got to be kidding me.

351
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,869
Come on.

352
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:20,983
What's wrong?

353
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,028
Are you scared?

354
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,073
Is that why you can't come in?

355
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,866
No.

356
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:33,120
I'm hesitating
because I might kill you at any moment.

357
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,002
Then do it.

358
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,213
Go for it.

359
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,840
Do whatever you want.

360
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,347
You don't have to get blood on your hands.

361
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,810
You wouldn't want it
to be that quick, would you?

362
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,062
What game are you playing?!

363
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,525
Think about it.

364
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,444
Then you'll know…

365
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,823
what the most painful death…

366
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,035
will be to me.

367
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,636
Just say the words.

368
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,599
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you."

369
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,185
That's all I want to hear.

370
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,733
I don't need you to forgive me.

371
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,943
Why not?!

372
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,488
Because even I…

373
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,493
won't forgive myself.

374
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,222
Where's Sergeant Tak?

375
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,623
This is her answer to your question.

376
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,762
What's this?

377
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,722
A map of the stadium.

378
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,267
Even the unverified area is marked.

379
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,692
She was never a coward,

380
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,696
so she must've
wanted to take responsibility.

381
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,429
Where's Hyun-su?

382
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,348
I thought he was with you.

383
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,808
You didn't see him?

384
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,476
No.

385
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,816
He'll be here.

386
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,326
He has no reason to run off.

387
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,578
So just relax and have some food.

388
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,747
We have a long way to go.

389
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,552
How is his style
just as lame as his personality?

390
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,817
Seriously?

391
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,821
You're eating without me?

392
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,281
You want to eat too?

393
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,325
Of course. Were you going to leave me out?

394
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,239
Did you stop doing drugs?

395
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,450
Don't torture yourself like this.

396
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,830
You might as well keep doing it.

397
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,581
Piss off.

398
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,796
Where are you going?

399
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,215
You're going to need something
to get better.

400
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,677
Do you even know what to look for?

401
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,554
I'll just pick everything I see.

402
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,932
You go back first. I'll be right back.

403
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:46,201
Can I ask you a question?

404
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,373
Was it you…

405
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,501
who killed Mr. Kim?

406
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,295
Who's that?

407
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:58,922
That day you saved Eun-yu.

408
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,260
This moron saved her countless times.

409
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,931
He doesn't kill humans.

410
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,476
You should know by now.

411
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,732
Wait.

412
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,276
You mean that pervert?

413
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,406
Even Cha Hyun-su lost his mind then.

414
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,701
It's a good thing
that man had already become a monster.

415
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:32,414
Otherwise, he would've cried for nights
about killing a human.

416
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,629
So he was symptomatic.

417
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,093
Do you…

418
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,137
like her?

419
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:48,764
What?

420
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,724
Cha Hyun-su does.

421
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,102
He's just hiding his feelings

422
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,856
and hovering around her like a wuss.

423
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,651
So what about you?

424
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:20,671
Where's Eun-yu?

425
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,602
Is this it?

426
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,952
What's on your mind?

427
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,207
Aren't you afraid of

428
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,835
what I might say?

429
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:00,919
Not at all.

430
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,089
I see.

431
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:09,344
Mom was always afraid
because I wasn't like her.

432
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,473
What about you, Dad?

433
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,268
Are you okay with who I am?

434
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,023
Of course.

435
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,319
You're more beautiful this way.

436
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,297
You said monsters don't harm you.

437
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,426
Show me.

438
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,431
If you do well…

439
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,018
I'll make sure you never feel pain again.

440
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,020
And I'll give you a gift.

441
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,564
A gift?

442
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,942
Anything you want.

443
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,321
Just let me know.

444
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:12,032
I'll always be with you.

445
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:39,935
Don't wake me up…

446
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:42,312
Wake up. Let's play.

447
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,564
Let's play.

448
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,441
Wake up.

449
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,493
Damn it.

450
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,288
Where on earth is she?

451
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:18,518
