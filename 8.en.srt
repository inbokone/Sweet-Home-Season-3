ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,976
SWEET HOME

3
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,223
Not yet!

4
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,941
When do we kill him then?

5
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,653
I'm begging you.

6
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,571
Don't do anything.

7
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,663
Go take a break.

8
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,290
I'll take care of this.

9
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,289
Watch out!

10
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,088
Get out.

11
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,317
I'm sorry I took so long.

12
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,659
It's not your fault.

13
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,620
It was…

14
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,331
my choice.

15
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,004
I was going to die with my dad.

16
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,440
I'm sorry.

17
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,318
I made…

18
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,572
another monster.

19
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,121
It's okay.

20
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,250
I'll take care of everything.

21
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,087
I can turn them back.

22
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,050
I'm…

23
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,096
going to die, won't I?

24
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,767
I'm glad.

25
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,104
Now I can go

26
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,565
and be with my mom.

27
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,277
Go.

28
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:21,988
Please go…

29
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,076
and kill my dad.

30
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,334
Something's different.

31
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,511
- Later--
- We'll talk later.

32
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,869
What the heck?

33
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:38,958
What are you waiting for?

34
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,668
Let's go.

35
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,133
Is this even safe?

36
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,676
We have no choice.

37
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,928
- Then you go first.
- Yeah, you go first.

38
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,638
Wait, why me?

39
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,242
Damn it.

40
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,578
Pass through.

41
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,997
One at a time.

42
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,296
Keep going.

43
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,772
You can't go.

44
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,483
Monsters can't pass through.

45
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,194
You can't go.

46
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,451
What's wrong?

47
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,005
Go on.

48
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,677
I said go on.

49
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,609
What is it?

50
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,155
You can't pass through?

51
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,452
Fuck!

52
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,875
Stop trying so hard, you monster.

53
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,134
Stand back.

54
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,231
Fuck this shit!

55
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,367
Are you here to kill me too?

56
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,453
Just die.

57
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,788
Let's all fucking die together!

58
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,582
Die!

59
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,546
Are you okay?

60
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,605
Go!

61
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,440
Hurry!

62
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,535
Go.

63
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,162
Hurry!

64
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,040
- What about you?
- I can't hold on much longer.

65
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,626
- Just go!
- Go! Hurry!

66
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,753
- Go!
- You fucking bastard…

67
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,133
Let's go.

68
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,696
Hold my hand.

69
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,409
Go!

70
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,123
That bitch.

71
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,483
How persistent.

72
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,820
Go hide.

73
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,326
Go hide again, you fucking rat.

74
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,897
You're barely doing anything to him.

75
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,483
I'll kill each body he takes over.

76
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,401
Until when?

77
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,404
Are you going to fight him
every time he does?

78
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:24,905
That won't end.

79
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,031
Then what?!

80
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,371
What do you suggest I do?

81
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,873
Me.

82
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,961
He needs a body.

83
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,546
I'll give up mine.

84
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,674
Once he takes over,

85
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,844
I'll stay in the fire
until he burns to death.

86
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,762
So you're going to die with him?

87
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,849
I told you, I can't die.

88
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,977
I don't believe you.

89
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,146
Cha Hyun-su.

90
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,773
Let's end this here.

91
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,694
You need to live.

92
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,531
It's time we stopped this nonsense.

93
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,600
He knows exactly what your weakness is.

94
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,695
Don't hold me back this time.

95
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,030
I'll do it.

96
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,033
That's not Sang-wook.

97
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,328
I had to deal with this from the start.

98
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,412
I can't let you.

99
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,665
If you get taken over,

100
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,084
it'll be harder to kill him.

101
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,001
That's right.

102
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,838
You two

103
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,133
can never kill me.

104
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,598
Never.

105
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:24,984
What the fuck?

106
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,198
I hate this fucking body!

107
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,539
Get out.

108
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,500
Get out.

109
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,377
Get out of my head!

110
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,930
If I die, you die too.

111
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,183
You don't want to die either.

112
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,853
I know you don't want to!

113
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,230
Isn't that why you're still around?

114
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,446
You don't want to die!

115
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,115
Don't do this.

116
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,033
No.

117
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,743
Sang-wook.

118
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,496
He was alive.

119
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,916
No!

120
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,419
No!

121
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,197
Mine were all burned.

122
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,870
I have nothing left.

123
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,832
I fought by praying.

124
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,376
I'm sure you had your own method.

125
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,508
Try to fight in a different way.

126
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:19,973
I think

127
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,850
there's a monster here.

128
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,685
Let's kill it.

129
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,020
We can kill it.

130
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,906
Go first.

131
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:07,122
IN LOVING MEMORY
HAVE A GREAT LIFE

132
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,053
I'm going to work now.

133
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,721
Don't just eat ramyeon, okay?

134
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,349
Eat a proper meal, all right?

135
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,018
Please go away.

136
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,938
- Please leave me alone.
- I'll report you missing if you're gone.

137
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,067
Survivors in the building.

138
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,693
Stop.

139
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,279
- Please leave me alone.
- Take any food, medicine, and weapons

140
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,656
- you have and come to the first floor.
- Go away…

141
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,658
It'll be safer to stay together.

142
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,412
We survivors…

143
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,207
must stick together.

144
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,052
What are you doing here?

145
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,681
I looked everywhere for you.

146
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,894
I told you it's safer for us
to stay together.

147
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,439
Are you still mad at me?

148
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,163
It's all right.

149
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:27,883
Fuck.

150
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,722
It should at least be realistic.

151
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,058
This…

152
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,895
This feels…

153
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,446
too much like a lie.

154
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,739
All that rush just to come here?

155
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,617
I'm going.

156
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,161
Are you okay?

157
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,416
About what?

158
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,375
Everything.

159
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,128
All that's happened.

160
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:30,547
I'm fine.

161
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,220
Maybe it's better off that way.

162
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,683
If you can't feel anything…

163
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,979
I guess you also won't feel any pain.

164
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,192
Is turning monsters back into humans

165
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,820
just me

166
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,573
being selfish?

167
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,082
I wonder where Eun-yu is now.

168
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,626
If you were her,

169
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,546
where would you be?

170
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:13,798
I don't know.

171
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,676
But I know where she'll end up.

172
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,636
Where's that?

173
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,099
Find people like me

174
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,769
and go follow them.

175
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,073
Don't be too certain.

176
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,825
If I find Eun-yu first,

177
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,870
I'm going to turn her back.

178
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,539
Go ahead.

179
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,334
And as for you…

180
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,669
Don't wander off too far.

181
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,090
I need to

182
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,550
take you to Eun-yu.

183
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,429
Sounds like you'll be busy.

184
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,182
You always have the last word.

185
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:28,873
Learn.

186
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,168
With memories,
you can relearn your emotions.

187
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,465
The truck just got back
from the stadium, sir.

188
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,636
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

189
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,348
FOR HIV/AIDS

190
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,686
Look, more survivors!

191
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,482
- There are more survivors!
- More survivors are here!

192
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,838
I told you it's dangerous to be out here.

193
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,758
You heard him. It's dangerous.

194
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,593
Get back in first.

195
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,560
Hey!

196
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,149
Darn you.

197
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,069
Get out of my way!

198
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,698
- Good work.
- Thank you.

199
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,492
These are the last of the survivors.

200
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,743
We brought everyone, sir.

201
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,372
Hey!

202
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,709
- Hey!
- There you are, Jin-guk!

203
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,798
- Dad!
- My sweetie!

204
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,245
Is there anywhere else we can go?

205
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,330
Well…

206
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,791
Not anywhere nearby.

207
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,711
I suggest we expand our radius, sir.

208
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,713
Aren't you forgetting something?

209
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,385
Lee Eun-yu.

210
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,600
That brat.

211
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,518
She's taking so long.

212
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,814
If you were her,

213
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,485
where would you be?

214
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,778
Find people like me…

215
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,657
and go follow them.

216
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,912
I'm thinking of going to that place.

217
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,497
Where?

218
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,374
She might already be there.

219
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,044
It's possible.

220
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,129
If we need to move anyway,

221
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,715
why not go together?

222
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,242
That day,

223
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,204
we came across a group of neohumans.

224
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,519
It took a while for them
to be accepted by everyone,

225
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:15,274
and many are still doubtful.

226
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,151
TREE

227
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,320
However, we all agreed on one thing.

228
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,907
Living in harmony with them…

229
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,908
TALK WITH YOUR EXPRESSIONS

230
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:26,369
…was the only way
to protect ourselves from monsters.

231
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,846
Not everyone could return.

232
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,810
And yet…

233
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,358
And yet I wait.

234
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,511
While time continues to flow endlessly…

235
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,020
we need a place to bide our time

236
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,647
and a place to return to.

237
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,751
We've decided

238
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,878
to call that place

239
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,630
by the name…

240
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,010
Sweet Home.

241
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:08,914
