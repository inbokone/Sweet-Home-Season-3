ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,893
SWEET HOME

3
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,272
I was planning on killing myself.

4
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,401
But today, I'm leaving this place

5
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,361
to survive.

6
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:14,032
You can't die even if you want to.
You're a "Monster Human."

7
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,367
You'll do better than the others.

8
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,412
I have a feeling
that a very special MH will be born.

9
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,457
Can you develop a vaccine with my help?

10
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,834
Would you be fine even if you had to die?

11
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,836
I told you it was pointless.

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,004
Just admit it.

13
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,380
You're a monster.

14
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,715
Yes.

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,217
I am a monster.

16
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,396
Realize that there's nothing
you can protect.

17
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,067
Live in despair, unable to die.

18
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,574
There was nothing I could do.

19
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,664
I just wanted to become a decent person.

20
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,545
Do you want to die a pathetic death?

21
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,214
Is that what you want?

22
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,717
Liar.

23
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,303
I told you already

24
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,389
that I could help.

25
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,183
I can make your dreams come true.

26
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,810
Every single one.

27
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,231
Here it comes.

28
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,816
- There you go.
- Let's see.

29
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,859
Looks good, honey.

30
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,778
- Amazing.
- Try the soup first.

31
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,446
Come on. Try it, Hyun-su.

32
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,406
Here.

33
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,618
But this isn't real.

34
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,955
It doesn't matter
as long as you can be happy.

35
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:48,126
Go live in your dreams.

36
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,461
I'll suffer your hellish reality for you.

37
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:54,966
No.

38
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,136
How stubborn.

39
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,132
Hyun-su!

40
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,843
"You were a mistake."

41
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,136
"You're a monster."

42
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,721
I didn't give birth to a monster.

43
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,307
Did you use your hands
to turn them into monsters?

44
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,475
Yi-kyung!

45
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,478
Yi-kyung is badly hurt.

46
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,896
She could die.

47
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,939
Mom's not going to die.

48
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,232
So don't cry for her.

49
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,236
I swear she had no symptoms.

50
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,154
- How can she suddenly…
- It was her daughter.

51
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
Humans can't trigger monsterization.

52
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,337
Monsters are still human.

53
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,589
They're still alive within.

54
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,471
I can see it all, Eun-yu.

55
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,015
I can see the desires
of the people who turned.

56
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,229
But Yi-kyung still won't be happy there.

57
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,982
I have to put an end to this.

58
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,692
It has to be me.

59
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,611
It doesn't have to be you.

60
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,322
Why am I still alive?

61
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,743
I wish I had just turned into a monster.

62
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,678
Cha Hyun-su.

63
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,113
Are you going to hit me with that?

64
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,614
Bring him back.

65
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,825
Bring Hyun-su back.

66
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,035
He's hurt.

67
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,828
Leave him to rest.

68
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,289
I was just helping him out
because he was hurting.

69
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,457
Give me a break.

70
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,554
This is all your fault.

71
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,390
Wasn't Hyun-su in control?

72
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,894
I'm Hyun-su too.

73
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,437
The real Hyun-su, not you.

74
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,647
We agreed to help each other.

75
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,983
It wouldn't be great for me if he died.

76
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,653
Just leave him alone and get lost.

77
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,155
Really?

78
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,324
Would you be okay with that?

79
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,118
Would you be okay with Cha Hyun-su…

80
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,163
who's a weakling?

81
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,083
Yes.

82
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,633
What are you doing?

83
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,051
I don't know.

84
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,512
What should we do?

85
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,309
What do you want to do?

86
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,402
You crazy bastard!

87
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,364
Unbelievable.

88
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,212
Cha Hyun-su.

89
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,564
I knew you'd come back.

90
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,942
If you didn't drop dead, that is.

91
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,698
This place was everything to you too.

92
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,326
But I don't know who you are.

93
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,831
Well, that's how it is.

94
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,416
Being a public figure,

95
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,171
I can't recognize
everyone who recognizes me.

96
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,674
Were you a researcher?

97
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,759
I don't pay much attention to people.

98
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,595
I'm not so keen on them.

99
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,722
And yet, you seemed very interested in me.

100
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,348
Right.

101
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,642
So tell me.

102
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,271
Who are you?

103
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,735
Your first…

104
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,406
test subject.

105
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,051
I really wanted to show you.

106
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,929
MH-1, was it?

107
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,848
Or should I say

108
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,391
your friend,

109
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,977
Nam Sang-won?

110
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,404
Good to see you again.

111
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,824
I was worried

112
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,577
that you might be dead.

113
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,624
So you're Nam Sang-won?

114
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,960
What a load of bullshit.

115
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,127
Se-yeon.

116
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,674
You did this.

117
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,389
SANG-WON

118
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,099
Sang-won…

119
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,232
I'm sorry, Sang-won.

120
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,109
Seo Yi-kyung is dead.

121
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,073
Nam Sang-won's desires.

122
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,494
This happened because he wanted
to escape from the damned experiment.

123
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,666
I became free
thanks to the pain you gave me.

124
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,378
And you succeeded
in separating the monster.

125
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,346
Congratulations.

126
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,266
So is this the end for me?

127
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,560
Why would it be?

128
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,313
If anything, I'm grateful.

129
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,690
Monsterization made me who I am.

130
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,734
But it was you

131
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,028
who completed me.

132
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:14,947
Then why?

133
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,034
Why are you still here

134
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,952
after all that happened?

135
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,292
Follow me.

136
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,190
It's been a while, hasn't it?

137
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,525
Say hello.

138
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,737
MH-3?

139
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,739
I'm Hwang Chi-seong.

140
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,240
So as I said, MH-3.

141
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,493
I'm more used to that.

142
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,536
Well, names don't matter.

143
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,537
Right, number three?

144
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,872
Call me whatever you want.

145
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,958
I'll get to feel at ease thanks to you.

146
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,710
Unfortunately for you,

147
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,963
I'll be giving your friend a tough time.

148
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,186
Do you remember

149
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,188
the experiment you enjoyed conducting?

150
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,148
I thought I'd give it a go.

151
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,628
Yong-seok…

152
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,796
Yong-seok!

153
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,673
Sergeant Kim?

154
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,262
Yong-seok!

155
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,680
Sarge!

156
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,066
Make your choice.

157
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,901
You can take one with you.

158
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,737
We always keep our word.

159
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,285
What's the point of this experiment?

160
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,787
To find others like us.

161
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,499
We're stimulating desire,
which is the first step to monsterization.

162
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:40,926
Time out.

163
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,555
No!

164
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,515
No, Jong-hyun!

165
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,433
Jong-hyun!

166
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,022
No!

167
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,815
Jong-hyun!

168
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,405
Does this bother you?

169
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,491
Because you're also human?

170
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,493
No, because this is meaningless.

171
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,706
If what number three said is true,

172
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,001
there should be more MHs.

173
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,629
But it seems you haven't succeeded yet.

174
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,677
You're too greedy.

175
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,436
Do you want both of them dead?

176
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,898
You're running out of time.

177
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,858
Make your choice.

178
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,738
Sarge…

179
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,762
Sarge, no!

180
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:07,930
Don't do it!

181
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,014
Yong-seok.

182
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,809
No! This is all my fault!

183
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,060
No, it's not.

184
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,230
No one thinks it's your fault.

185
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,649
You have to survive, okay?

186
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,971
What the hell are you doing?

187
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,556
I'm just like you.

188
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,892
If I give up on you,

189
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,020
I'll give up on myself.

190
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,898
I'm getting all of you out.

191
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,941
Dumb bastard.

192
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,401
Get up.

193
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,570
Let's get out of here.

194
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,197
Come on.

195
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,564
Fuck!

196
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,707
Kill them.

197
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,758
I'll do it.

198
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,638
Don't let us down this time.

199
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,499
Yeong-hu!

200
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,345
Is this really the only way?

201
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,350
It was my first time.

202
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,438
I've seen the desires
of monsters many times,

203
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:49,068
but never to the level I did
with Yi-kyung.

204
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,740
There still might be a chance

205
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,785
if Yi-kyung realizes all of it is fake

206
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,745
just like I did.

207
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,455
So she could be herself again?

208
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,001
I've got to try.

209
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,504
Giving up isn't an option.

210
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,713
Then I'm going with you.

211
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,466
You've just got your mind back.

212
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,344
What if the monster takes control again?

213
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,261
No.

214
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,555
- You can't.
- Hey.

215
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,017
I'm sorry I keep making you wait,

216
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,852
but Yi-kyung is my priority right now.

217
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,896
I can't protect you too.

218
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,654
I promise

219
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,364
I'll bring her back.

220
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,162
You should go now.

221
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,997
And never come back.

222
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,623
Just forget it.

223
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,083
She didn't even ask you to stay.

224
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,640
Hey, pretty boy!

225
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,808
We meet again.

226
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,020
I told you we were meant to be.

227
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,818
Look.

228
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,946
It's your kid, Yi-kyung.

229
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,072
She wants her mother.

230
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,617
It can't be.

231
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,494
She's your baby.

232
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,411
No!

233
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,581
She's not? Then can I kill her?

234
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,667
- Is that you, Yi-kyung?
- No, stop!

235
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,543
Don't touch her!

236
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,170
Cut the act.

237
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,756
You don't love her that much.

238
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,300
Do you even have maternal love?

239
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,261
Please don't.

240
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,096
You wanted to kill her, didn't you?

241
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,641
That's what you wanted.

242
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,560
No, that's not true!

243
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,438
So you want to protect her?

244
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,858
Can you actually do it this time?

245
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,194
I can.

246
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,863
I can, so please…

247
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,345
Yi-kyung!

248
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,516
That's the monster you created.

249
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,649
It's taken so many lives,
all because of you.

250
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,527
What will you do?

251
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,364
It might kill your kid once and for all.

252
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,330
Just kill it.

253
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,337
Only then can you protect your kid.

254
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,348
Yi-kyung!

255
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,557
- Yi-kyung!
- Yi-kyung!

256
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,641
Get yourself together!

257
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,853
- Yi-kyung!
- That thing wants to kill your kid!

258
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,281
Wait.

259
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,909
Wait a minute.

260
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,161
I'll be right back.

261
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,746
I must've lost my damned mind.

262
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,645
Die, asshole!

263
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,488
Sergeant Kim!

264
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,414
You'll die if you go.

265
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,709
Why did you do it?

266
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,586
Why?

267
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,672
Why the hell did you do it?!

268
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,374
Seo-jin!

269
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,209
Sergeant Kim!

270
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,663
Where are we going?

271
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,540
Where you came from.

272
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,168
The fruit is almost ripe.

273
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,879
It's different this time.

274
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,549
Something extraordinary
is going to happen.

275
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,524
Lead the way.

276
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,403
We're going to the stadium.

277
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,953
Did the Crow Platoon really take Ye-seul?

278
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,371
Why would they?

279
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,291
Have you not found Seung-wan yet?

280
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,130
So is he a monster now
or did he hide the monsters?

281
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,340
That doesn't matter anymore.

282
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,925
He'll be punished either way.

283
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,120
I see Chief Ji, Sergeant Tak.

284
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,417
OFFICE

285
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,592
She just entered the office.

286
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,233
Where are we going?

287
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,904
Is this your way of apologizing?

288
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,491
It's all right, Mom. I understand you.

289
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,203
What's wrong?

290
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,455
Why won't you say anything?

291
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,458
Are you going to ignore me now?

292
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,252
I did everything you told me to!

293
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,339
Ye-seul.

294
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,132
I need your help.

295
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,843
From now on, those who hide their symptoms

296
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,721
and the ones who harbor them
will face immediate consequences.

297
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,274
Did you know about this?

298
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,985
I had no idea.

299
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,529
Mom, come on.

300
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,239
Mom!

301
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,003
You put me in danger.

302
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,177
This is the last time I'm helping you.

303
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,472
Go out this way. It's the exit.

304
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,058
Or go back to Sergeant Tak.

305
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,477
Mom, please.

306
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,520
I'm sorry, okay?

307
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,147
Don't do this to me.

308
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,064
Mom!

309
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,693
Why do you keep calling me that?

310
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,448
Your real mom became a monster
and died a year ago.

311
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,078
Do you realize how much
I wanted to be called mom?

312
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,125
I even wanted to hear it in my dreams.

313
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,793
But not by you.

314
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,129
By my son.

315
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,008
Got it?

316
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,556
My son.

317
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,356
I can't believe myself.

318
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:42,197
I guess living together for a while
made me care about you.

319
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,492
I almost made a big mistake.

320
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,498
Where does that lead to?

321
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,882
You should've left
when I gave you the chance.

322
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,885
Mom, please don't do this to me.

323
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,187
I swear I saw her come in here.

324
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,104
But…

325
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,319
Mom, please.

326
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,404
Mom!

327
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,573
I'm scared.

328
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,747
Say hello, Ye-seul.

329
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,124
This is my son.

330
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,734
My son!

331
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,111
My son!

332
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,186
Hey, brat.

333
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,314
You're still alive.

334
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,116
How long has it been?

335
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,953
Just so you know,

336
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,205
there's nothing we can do.

337
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,291
I know.

338
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,295
He said to wait, didn't he?

339
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,014
I'll give you a signal.

340
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,590
Yi-kyung!

341
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,966
You have to stop.

342
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,635
We need to go back.

343
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,180
Please stop. Get yourself together.

344
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,306
Yi-kyung!

345
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,740
We won't last long here.

346
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,325
Don't tell me we're abandoning them now.

347
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,869
We need to pull them up or something.

348
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,070
No!

349
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,786
We need more time.

350
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,206
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

351
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,207
Untie me.

352
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,500
Untie me now.

353
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,710
Let me go!

354
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,342
Let me go!

355
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,970
Chan-yeong, no!

356
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,639
No!

357
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,992
Park Chan-yeong!

358
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,718
Cha Hyun-su!

359
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,305
Cha Hyun-su!

360
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,182
Wake up!

361
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,738
Mom!

362
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,417
Over here.

363
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,961
Mom, I'm over here!

364
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,721
Yi-kyung.

365
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,223
We have to go.

366
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,766
Hurry.

367
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,228
She's not your kid.

368
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,522
Your real kid is waiting for you.

369
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,482
We need to leave.

370
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,400
Let's go.

371
00:37:58,985 --> 00:37:59,902
No.

372
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,821
Come on, hurry.

373
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:02,863
No.

374
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,200
- Let's go.
- No!

375
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,757
No!

376
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,611
Cha Hyun-su!

377
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:38,814
